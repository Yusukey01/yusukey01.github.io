Future Update

Graph: 

    Graph Fourier Transform
    Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)

    Network Flow, Max-flow min-cut theorem and applications in ML.

    PageRank algorithm and its role in search engines.

Discrete Optimization in ML
    Integer Programming & Combinatorial Optimization
    Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) in AI
    Game Theory & Adversarial ML
...................................................................................................................

Time Series Analysis:
    Place this as a final, standalone section right after Markov Chains.
    Time series analysis (including AR, MA, ARIMA models) builds on the idea of sequential dependencies introduced by Markov 
    chains and addresses data with temporal structure, which is highly relevant for many ML applications.

I- Linear Algebra to Algebraic Foundations
    missing- Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse (A+) -> Part 8 LS Problem or new section A^TA is singular or non-square
    deeper- Tensor Decomposition -> Part 11 (for data compression in deep learning)

    ***Abstruct Algebra : Marked optional to skip these section 
        Group Theory: Why and how can we formalize transformations and symmetries?
        Ring Theory: Why does division sometimes fail with integers or matrices?
        Field Theory: What special structure guarantees our scalars (R) always allow division for vector space?
