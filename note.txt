1:Monte Carlo Methods & Simulation
Where to Insert:
Introduce this topic as a new section between Part 16: Bayesian Decision Theory and Part 17: Markov Chains.
Rationale:
Monte Carlo techniques, including MCMC methods, are essential for simulation-based inference and complement decision 
theory before moving on to sequential models like Markov chains.

2:Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC):
Add a dedicated sub-section or new part immediately following Part 17. This section would build on the Markov chains 
background to explain algorithms like Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings.

3:Time Series Analysis
Where to Insert:
Place this as a final, standalone section right after Part 17: Markov Chains.
Rationale:
Time series analysis (including AR, MA, ARIMA models) builds on the idea of sequential dependencies introduced by Markov 
chains and addresses data with temporal structure, which is highly relevant for many ML applications.
