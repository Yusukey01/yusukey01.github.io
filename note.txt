3:Time Series Analysis
Where to Insert:
Place this as a final, standalone section right after Part 17: Markov Chains.
Rationale:
Time series analysis (including AR, MA, ARIMA models) builds on the idea of sequential dependencies introduced by Markov 
chains and addresses data with temporal structure, which is highly relevant for many ML applications.
