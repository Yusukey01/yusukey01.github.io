Time Series Analysis:
    Place this as a final, standalone section right after Markov Chains.
    Time series analysis (including AR, MA, ARIMA models) builds on the idea of sequential dependencies introduced by Markov 
    chains and addresses data with temporal structure, which is highly relevant for many ML applications.

                    Suppose \((X, d)\) and \((Y, e)\) are metric spaces and \(\phi: X \to Y\). Then \(\phi\) is called an
                    <strong>isometry</strong> or an <strong>Isometric map</strong> if and only if 
                    \[
                    \forall a, b \in X, \, e(\phi(a), \phi(b)) = d(a, b).
                    \]
                    Moreover, the metric subspace \((\phi(X), e)\) of \(Y, e\) is an <strong>isometric copy</strong> of the 
                    space \((X, d)\).

                    A metric space \((X, d)\) is called a <strong>discrete metric space</strong> if and only if all its subsets
