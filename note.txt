Time Series Analysis:
    Place this as a final, standalone section right after Markov Chains.
    Time series analysis (including AR, MA, ARIMA models) builds on the idea of sequential dependencies introduced by Markov 
    chains and addresses data with temporal structure, which is highly relevant for many ML applications.

                    A metric space \((X, d)\) is called a <strong>discrete metric space</strong> if and only if all its subsets

                    Suppose \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and for each \(i \in \mathbb{N}_n\), \((X, \tau_i)\) is a metric space. The collection

                    a <strong>product metric</strong> on \(\prod_{i=1}^n X_i\).
