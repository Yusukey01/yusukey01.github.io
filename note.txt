Time Series Analysis:
    Place this as a final, standalone section right after Markov Chains.
    Time series analysis (including AR, MA, ARIMA models) builds on the idea of sequential dependencies introduced by Markov 
    chains and addresses data with temporal structure, which is highly relevant for many ML applications.

                    A metric space \((X, d)\) is called a <strong>discrete metric space</strong> if and only if all its subsets 
                    are open and therefore also closed in \(X\).

                    Suppose \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and for each \(i \in \mathbb{N}_n\), \((X, \tau_i)\) is a metric space. The collection 
                    of all unions of members of \(\{\prod_{i=1}^n U_i \mid U_i \text{ open in } X_i\}\) is called the 
                    <strong>product topology</strong> on \(P = \prod_{i = 1}^n X_i\). Any metric on \(P\) that generates the product topology is called 
                    a <strong>product metric</strong> on \(\prod_{i=1}^n X_i\).
