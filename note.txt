Future Update

Graph: 

    Graph Fourier Transform
    Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)

    Network Flow, Max-flow min-cut theorem and applications in ML.

    PageRank algorithm and its role in search engines.

Discrete Optimization in ML
    Integer Programming & Combinatorial Optimization
    Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) in AI
    Game Theory & Adversarial ML
...................................................................................................................

Time Series Analysis:
    Place this as a final, standalone section right after Markov Chains.
    Time series analysis (including AR, MA, ARIMA models) builds on the idea of sequential dependencies introduced by Markov 
    chains and addresses data with temporal structure, which is highly relevant for many ML applications.

I- Linear Algebra --> "to Algebraic Foundations" 
    missing- Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse (A+) -> Part 8 LS Problem or new section A^TA is singular or non-square
    deeper- Tensor Decomposition -> Part 11 (for data compression in deep learning)

II- Calculus to Opt and Analysis
    missing- Advanced Function Spaces/ Operators  
    -> new Functional Analysis section (Hilbert Spaces for Kernel Methods, variational Methods)
    Topological Concepts s.t. Completeness, Compactness

    deeper- Advanced Second Order methods -> Part 8 Newton (Trust-Region Methods beter convergence than Newton)

III- Statistics
    missing- Variational Inference(VI) -> new section after Part 14 intro Bayesian (scalable alternative to MCMC for complex Bayesian models with KL divergenvce)
    missing- Causal Inference/ DAGs -> new section increasingly critical area of AI that goes beyond correlation(Do-Calculus, Structural Causal Models)
    deeper- Part19 -> Hamiltonian MC and NUTS(for high dim Baysian)

IV- Discreate
    missing- Computational Learning Theory (COLT) -> after Part 9 Class NP (Probably Approximately Correct learning and VC-Dimension)
    deeper- Advanced Graph -> +Part 1 or 8 (Network flows Max-flow, min-cut, Matching theory with combinatorial optimization)

V- ML
    missing- Generative Models (Explicit Math) -> new (Generative Adversarial Networks, Diffusion Models, KL div Stochastic Processes)
    deeper- Statistical Learning Theory -> new section (Generalization Bounds)
