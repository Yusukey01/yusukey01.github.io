# MATH-CS COMPASS

> Bridging Pure & Applied Mathematics with Computer Science and Machine Learning

MATH-CS COMPASS is a free educational platform designed to address the gap where computer science students struggle with mathematical foundations while mathematics students lack awareness of practical applications. The ultimate goal is building rigorous mathematical foundations for Geometric Deep Learning—a core paradigm in the AI industry.

## Philosophy

Mathematics is the study of **structure**. This platform offers an accessible yet principled look at the mathematical blueprints that power modern technology. Specific tools and frameworks become outdated, but mathematical foundations are eternal.

The curriculum spans two worlds:
- **The Continuous World** (Calculus, Analysis): Smooth functions, limits, optimization
- **The Discrete World** (Algebra, Algorithms): Finite structures, logic, computation

Machine Learning sits at the intersection, synthesizing both worlds.
