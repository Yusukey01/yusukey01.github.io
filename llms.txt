## Project Philosophy
MATH-CS COMPASS is a free educational platform designed to bridge the gap between the rigorous logic of pure mathematics and the practical innovation of computer science. The ultimate goal is to build rigorous mathematical foundations for modern Artificial Intelligence, specifically Geographic Deep Learning and Physical AI. 

Mathematics is treated as the **study of structure**. The curriculum spans two primary domains:
1. **The Continuous World**: Calculus, Analysis, and Optimization (smooth change, infinite processes).
2. **The Discrete World**: Algebra, Graph Theory, and Algorithms (finite structures, rigid logic).

**Probability & Statistics** serves as the bridge between these worlds, translating structure into the language of uncertainty. All paths ultimately converge in **Machine Learning**, representing the grand synthesis of these disciplines.

## Interactive Features
- **Interactive Knowledge Map**: [map/compass.html](https://math-cs-compass.com/map/compass.html) - A hexagonal node map displaying prerequisites and learning paths.
- **Tessera**: An AI learning companion providing context-aware guidance.
- **Interactive Demos**: Python/JavaScript visualizations leveraging Pyodide.
