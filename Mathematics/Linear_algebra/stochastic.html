                 <p>
                    Many real-world systems evolve probabilistically: a customer's next purchase depends on their current 
                    preferences, a web user's next click depends on the current page, and weather tomorrow depends on 
                    conditions today. To model such processes using linear algebra, we need matrices whose columns (or rows) 
                    represent probability distributions. These are called <strong>stochastic matrices</strong>, and they 
                    form the algebraic backbone of <strong>Markov chains</strong>.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        A <strong>probability vector</strong> \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is a vector with nonnegative entries that sum 
                        to 1:
                        \[
                        x_i \geq 0 \text{ for all } i, \quad \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1.
                        \]
                        A <strong>stochastic matrix</strong> (or <strong>transition matrix</strong>) \(P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is 
                        a square matrix whose columns are probability vectors. That is, \(P_{ij} \geq 0\) for all \(i, j\), 
                        and \(\sum_{i=1}^n P_{ij} = 1\) for each column \(j\).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Note that while any matrix satisfying these conditions is a stochastic matrix, further properties such as 
                    <strong>irreducibility</strong> and <strong>aperiodicity</strong> (making the matrix <strong>regular</strong>) 
                    are required to guarantee convergence to a unique stationary distribution.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In this page, we will use the <strong>column-stochastic matrix</strong>, but we can also use the 
                    <strong>row-stochastic matrix</strong>. Essentially, the choice between a row-stochastic and a column-stochastic 
                    matrix is a matter of convention and convenience, and both formulations are equivalent up to taking a transpose. 
                    Using the row-stochastic matrix is often natural in Markov chains because each row directly tells 
                    you the probabilities of transitioning from a given state to all other states. In linear algebra context, due to 
                    the form of \(Ax = b\), the column-stochastic matrix can be chosen more often. (Also, many programming environments 
                    default to column vectors.)

                    <h3>Insight: Row vs Column Convention in ML Frameworks</h3>
                    <p>
                        In practice, most machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) adopt the 
                        <strong>row-stochastic</strong> convention, where each row \(\sum_j P_{ij} = 1\). This aligns with the 
                        standard data representation where each <strong>row</strong> corresponds to a sample. For example, 
                        a <strong>Softmax</strong> layer applied across the final dimension of a hidden representation 
                        produces a row-stochastic matrix. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mathematically, if \(x\) is a column vector, the update rule for a column-stochastic matrix is \(x_{k+1} = P x_k\). 
                        In code, using row-stochastic matrices and row vectors \(x^\top\), this becomes \(x_{k+1}^\top = x_k^\top P^\top\) 
                        (often written simply as \(XW\) in linear layers). Always verify the matrix orientation to avoid 
                        incorrect broadcasting or transpositions in your custom layers.
                    </p>
                </div>
               
                <p>
                    Remember, a <a href="../Probability/markov.html"><strong>Markov chain</strong></a> is a sequence of probability 
                    vectors \(x_0, x_1, x_2, \cdots \) together with a stochastic matrix \(P\) 
                    such that 
                    \[
                    x_1 = P x_0, \quad x_2 = P x_1, \quad x_3 = P x_2, \quad \cdots.
                    \]
                    So, the Markov chain is explained by the first-order difference equation:
                    \[
                    x_{k+1} = P x_k \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \cdots.
                    \]
                    Here, \(x_k\) is called a <strong>state vector</strong> and we have:
                    \[
                    x_k = P^k x_0  \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \cdots.
                    \]
                </p>
                
                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Example: </span>
                    <p>
                        Consider the following two states:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> State 1: a student is sick</li>
                        <li> State 2: a student is not sick</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p>
                        We observed an initial state distribution:
                        \[
                        x_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 \\ 0.9 \end{bmatrix}
                        \]
                        which means that currently, 10% of students are sick and 90% are not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, we assume the following conditions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 70% of sick students recover the next day, and 30% remain sick.</li>
                        <li> 5% of healthy students become sick the next day, and 95% remain healthy.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p>
                        So, our stochastic matrix can be written as 
                        \[
                        P = \begin{bmatrix} 0.3 & 0.05 \\ 0.7 & 0.95 \end{bmatrix}.
                        \]
                        Then, 
                        \[
                        x_1 = P x_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 0.3 & 0.05 \\ 0.7 & 0.95 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 \\ 0.9 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.075 \\ 0.925 \end{bmatrix}
                        \]
                        This means that on the next day, approximately 7.5% students are expected to be sick and 92.5% are not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can continue this process:
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        &x_2 = P x_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 0.3 & 0.05 \\ 0.7 & 0.95 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.075 \\ 0.925 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.06875 \\ 0.93125 \end{bmatrix} \\\\
                        &x_3 = P x_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0.3 & 0.05 \\ 0.7 & 0.95 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.06875 \\ 0.93125 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.0671875 \\ 0.9328125 \end{bmatrix}
                        \end{align*}
                        \]
                        and so on.

                     <p>
                        A <strong>steady-state vector</strong> \(q\) for a stochastic matrix \(P\) is defined as 
                        \[
                        P q = q.
                        \]
                        In statistics, we also call it <strong>stationary distribution</strong>. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    For a <strong>regular stochastic matrix</strong> (one where some power \(P^k\) has all strictly positive entries), 
                    the Markov chain \(\{x_k : k = 1, 2, \cdots\}\) converges to a <strong>unique steady-state vector \(q\)</strong> as
                     \(k \to \infty\), regardless of the initial distribution \(x_0\). This ensures the system eventually settles into a 
                     predictable long-term equilibrium, losing all memory of its starting state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Algebraically, the steady-state vector \(q\) is the <strong>principal eigenvector</strong> of \(P\) associated with the 
                    eigenvalue \(\lambda_1 = 1\). The Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees that for regular matrices, this eigenvalue is unique 
                    and its corresponding eigenvector can be normalized to form a valid probability distribution.

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Spectral Radius</span>
                      <p>
                        For any matrix \(A\), the <strong>spectral radius</strong> \(\rho(A)\) is defined by the maximum absolute value 
                        of its eigenvalues. It satisfies
                        \[
                        \rho(A) \leq \| A \|
                        \]
                        for any submultiplicative matrix norm \(\| \cdot \| \).
                    </p>
                </div>
   
                <p>
                    By definition, every column of a column-stochastic matrix sums to 1, which means the maximum absolute column sum 
                    (the <strong>1-norm</strong>, \(\| P \|_1\)) is always 1. According to the property of submultiplicative norms, 
                    the <strong>spectral radius</strong> satisfies:
                    \[ 
                    \rho(P) \leq \| P \|_1 = 1 
                    \]
                    (For the row-stochastic matrix, we use the <strong>infinity norm</strong> \(\| P \|_{\infty} = 1\) to reach the 
                    same conclusion.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the vector \(\mathbf{1}^\top = [1, 1, \dots, 1]\) is a left-eigenvector of \(P\) associated with the 
                    eigenvalue 1 (satisfying \(\mathbf{1}^\top P = \mathbf{1}^\top\)), we know that \(\lambda = 1\) is always an 
                    eigenvalue of any stochastic matrix. Therefore, the spectral radius is <strong>exactly 1</strong> (\(\rho(P) = 1\)). 
                    For a regular stochastic matrix, all other eigenvalues \(\lambda_i\) satisfy \(|\lambda_i| < 1\), which ensures that 
                    the influence of non-steady-state components vanishes as \(k \to \infty\).

                        Revisiting our example, 
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}

                        & q_1 + q_2 = 1 \\\\
                        &\Longrightarrow q = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{15} \\ \frac{14}{15} \end{bmatrix}

                        \]
                        which means that in the long run, about 6.67 % of the students will be sick and about 93.33 % will be not sick.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Find eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors:
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        &\det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \\\\
                        &\Longrightarrow \lambda^2 - 1.25\lambda + 0.25 = 0 \\\\
                        &\Longrightarrow (\lambda -1)(\lambda -0.25) = 0 \\\\
                        &\Longrightarrow \lambda_1 = 1, \quad \lambda_2 = 0.25.
                        \end{align*}
                        \]
                        For \(\lambda_1 = 1\), solving \((P -I)v_1 = 0\), we obtain the corresponding eigenvector:

                        \]
                        (Scaling by \(\frac{1}{15}\), we can get the stationary distribution \(q = \frac{1}{15}v_1\)).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For \(\lambda_2 = 0.25\), solving \((P -0.25I)v_2 = 0\), we obtain the corresponding eigenvector:
                        \[
                        v_2 =  \begin{bmatrix} - 1 \\  1 \end{bmatrix}.
                        \]
                        So, 
                        \[
                        V = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & - 1 \\ 14 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad V^{-1} = \frac{1}{15} \begin{bmatrix}  1 & 1 \\ -14 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, 
                        \]
                        and 
                        \[
                        D = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 & 0\\ 0 & \lambda_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.25 \end{bmatrix}

                    <p>
                        Thus, the transition matrix \(P\) after \(k\) steps can be written as:

                        \begin{align*}
                        P^k &= V D^k V^{-1} \\\\

                        The error in the state distribution after \(k\) steps is dominated by the term \(\lambda_2^k = (0.25)^k\). Thus, the 
                        convergence rate of the Markov chain toward the stationary distribution is exponential, with each additional step reducing 
                        the error roughly by a factor of \(0.25\):

                        \]
                        where \(e_0\) is the initial error.

                    In this example, \(P\) is <a href="eigenvectors.html"><strong>diagonalizable</strong></a>, which allowed us 
                    to express \(P^k\) in closed form and read off the convergence rate directly from the eigenvalues. In general, 
                    stochastic matrices are not always diagonalizable, but the convergence result still holds under mild 
                    conditions (irreducibility and aperiodicity) via the Perron-Frobenius theorem.

                        For \(n = 2\), the doubly stochastic constraint forces the matrix to be symmetric. 
                        Consider the following doubly stochastic matrix for \(0 < t \leq 1\):
                        \[
                        A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 - t & t \\  t & 1 - t \end{bmatrix}.
                        \]
                        The trace is \(\text{tr}(A) = 2 - 2t\). Since every stochastic matrix has eigenvalue 
                        \(\lambda_1 = 1\) with corresponding eigenvector \(v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\), 
                        we can find the second eigenvalue from
                        \[
                        \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 = \text{tr}(A) = 2 - 2t \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \lambda_2 = 1 - 2t.
                        \]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since \(A\) is symmetric and the two eigenvalues are distinct (for \(t \neq 0\)), the 
                        <a href="orthogonality.html">spectral theorem</a> guarantees that the eigenvectors are orthogonal. 
                        Thus \(v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\), and the eigendecomposition is
                        \[
                        A = \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} 
                        \begin{bmatrix} 1  & 0 \\ 0 & 1-2t \end{bmatrix} 
                        \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
                        \]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that the eigenvector matrix \(V = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\) satisfies 
                        \(V^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}V\), since the columns are orthogonal with squared norm 2.

                    <h3>Insight: Doubly Stochastic Matrices in Machine Learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        Doubly stochastic matrices are the cornerstone of <strong>Optimal Transport (OT)</strong>. 
                        The <strong>Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm</strong> transforms a raw cost matrix into a doubly stochastic 
                        assignment matrix through iterative scaling. This approach is highly valued in modern AI 
                        (e.g., Wasserstein GANs, SuperGlue for feature matching) because it is <strong>fully differentiable</strong> 
                        and enables entropic regularization, turning a hard combinatorial matching problem into a smooth, GPU-friendly 
                        optimization.

                    <p>
                        In <strong>Spectral Clustering</strong>, ensuring the affinity matrix is normalized into a stochastic form 
                        relates to the random walk Laplacian. Since the steady-state of a doubly stochastic matrix is always the 
                        <strong>uniform distribution</strong> \(q = \frac{1}{n}\mathbf{1}\), these matrices are ideal for modeling 
                        systems where no prior bias exists, such as in data shuffling, sorting networks, or fair resource allocation.
