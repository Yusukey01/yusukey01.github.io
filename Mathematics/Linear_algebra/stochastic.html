        <h1>Stochastic Matrix</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A <strong>probability vector</strong> \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is a vetor with nonnegative entries that add up 
            to 1, and A <strong>stochastic matrix</strong> \(P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is a square matrix whose columns 
            are probability vectors.
            <br><br>
            A <a href="../Probability/markov.html"><strong>Markov chain</strong></a>: is a sequence of probability 
            vectors \(x_0, x_1, x_2, \cdots \) tohether with a stochastic matrix \(P\) 
            such that 
            \[
            x_1 = P x_0, \quad x_2 = P x_1, \quad x_3 = P x_2, \quad \cdots.
            \]
            So, the Markov chain is explained by the first-order difference equation:
            \[
            x_{k+1} = P x_k \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \cdots.
            \]
            Here, \(x_k\) is called a <strong>state vector</strong>.

            <div class="proof">
                <span class="proof-title">Example: </span>
                Consider the following two states:
                <ul>
                    <li> State 1: a student is sick</li>
                    <li> State 2: a student is not sick</li>
                </ul>
                We obserbed an initial state distribution:
                \[
                x_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 \\ 0.9 \end{bmatrix}
                \]
                which means now, 10 % of students are 90 % are not.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, we assume the following conditions:
                <ul>
                    <li> 70% of sick students recover the next day and 30 % remain sick.</li>
                    <li> 5 % of not sick students become sick the next day and 95 % remain not sick</li>
                </ul>
                So, our stochastic matrix can be written as 
                \[
                P = \begin{bmatrix} 0.3 & 0.7 \\ 0.05 & 0.95 \end{bmatrix}.
                \]
                Then, 
                \[
                x_1 = P x_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 0.3 & 0.7 \\ 0.05 & 0.95 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 \\ 0.9 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.075 \\ 0.925 \end{bmatrix}
                \]
                This means that on the next day, approximately 7.5 % students are expected to be sick and 92.5 % are not.
            </div>

        <h1>Steady-state Vector</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A <strong>steady-state vector</strong> \(q\) for a stochastic matrix \(P\) is defined as 
            \[
            P q = q.
            \]
            In statistics, we also call it <strong>stationary distribution</strong>.
            <br><br>
            The eigenvalues of the stochastic matrix \(P\) provide insight into how fast the Markov chain converges to 
            the stationary distribution. So, we can solve:
            \[
            \det(P - \lambda I) = 0.
            \]
            In our example, we obtain
            \(\lambda_1 = 1\), and \(\lambda_2 = 0.25\).
            The convergence rate is governed by \(\lambda_2\).
