                <h2>Cosets: Partitioning the Group</h2>
                <p>
                    Up to this point, we have treated groups as individual, isolated objects. We have explored the 
                    "internal clockwork" of cyclic groups and the "shuffling" mechanics of symmetric groups. However, 
                    the true power of group theory lies in <strong>structural analysis</strong> - understanding how groups 
                    relate to one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this page, we shift our focus from "What is a group?" to "How do groups map to each other?" 
                    We will develop the tools to partition groups into meaningful blocks (cosets), simplify complex 
                    groups into smaller "quotient" structures, and prove that seemingly different groups are actually 
                    identical in structure (isomorphism).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In computer science, we often use equivalence relations to categorize data into buckets. 
                    In group theory, <strong>cosets</strong> serve a similar purpose. Given a subgroup \( H \), 
                    we can use it to "slice" the parent group \( G \) into disjoint pieces of equal size.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Cosets</span>  
                    Let \(H\) be a nonempty subset of a group \(G\).  For any \(a \in G\), we define:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    aH &= \{ah \mid h \in H\} (\text{ The left coset of } H \text{ in } G \text{ containing } a. ), \\\\
                    Ha &= \{ha \mid h \in H\} (\text{ The right coset of } H \text{ in } G \text{ containing } a. ), \\\\
                    aHa^{-1} &= \{aha^{-1} \mid h \in H\}. 
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    The element \(a\) is called the <strong>coset representative</strong> of \(aH\) (or \(Ha\)). 
                    <br>
                    We denote \(|aH|\) (or \(Ha\)) as the  number of elements in the set \(aH\) (or \(Ha\)).

                        Consider the additive group of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) and its subgroup 
                        \[

                        \] 
                        To find the cosets, we pick an element \( a \in \mathbb{Z} \) and add it to every element in \( H \):

                        This illustrates that the cosets are exactly the <strong>equivalence classes</strong> of the "modulo" relation. 
                        In CS terms, this is the mathematical foundation of a hash map where the keys are remainders.

                    The following properties define how cosets behave as the "building blocks" of a group.

                    From a structural perspective, <strong>Property 3</strong> implies that a coset is <strong>uniquely determined</strong> 
                    by any one of its elements (any element can act as a "representative"). <strong>Property 4</strong> ensures that these 
                    cosets never partially overlap. Combining these with <strong>Property 6</strong>, we arrive at a powerful conclusion: 
                    the left (or right) cosets of \(H\) <strong>partition \(G\) into disjoint blocks of equal size</strong>. In Computer Science, 
                    this is the exact behavior of an <strong>equivalence relation</strong> used in partitioning algorithms.

                <h2>Lagrange's Theorem</h2>
                
                <p>
                    The properties of cosets we have just explored lead to one of the most fundamental results in finite group theory. 
                    If cosets partition a group into disjoint blocks of equal size, then the total number of elements in the group must 
                    be a simple multiple of the size of any of its subgroups. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, this theorem imposes a rigid "divisibility constraint" on the structure of finite groups: 
                    a subgroup cannot just be any size; its order must be a divisor of the parent group's order.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Lagrange's Theorem</span>  
                    <p>
                        If \(H\) is a subgroup of a finite group \(G\), then \(|H|\) divides \(|G|\). Moreover, 
                        the number of distinct left (or right) cosets of \(H\) in \(G\) is \(|G| / |H|\).
                    </p>

                        Let \(a_1 H, \, a_2 H, \, \ldots, \, a_r H\) denote the distinct left cosets of \(H\) in \(G\).
                        For any \(a \in G\), Property 1 guarantees that \(a \in aH\). Since the cosets \(a_1 H, \ldots, a_r H\) 
                        exhaust all distinct cosets, we have \(aH = a_i H\) for some \(i\), which means \(a \in a_i H\). 
                        Therefore, every element of \(G\) belongs to one of these cosets:
                        \[
                        G = a_1 H \cup \cdots \cup a_r H.
                        \]
                        By Property 4, this union is disjoint, so:
                        \[
                        |G| = |a_1 H| + |a_2 H| + \cdots + |a_r H|.
                        \]
                        Since \(\forall i, \, |a_i H| = |H|\) by Property 6, we have \(|G| = r |H|\).
                        Therefore, 
                        \[
                        r = \frac{|G|}{|H|}.
                        \]

                        By the division algorithm:

                        Thus, \(a \bmod p = r\) and it suffices to prove that \(r^p \bmod p = r\). If \(r =0\), the 
                        result is trivial, we assume that \(r \in U(p)\). (Note that \(U(p) = \{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}\) under

                    us to reduce massive exponents in modular arithmetic (essential for RSA), and Corollary 4 provides a 
                    fast probabilistic test for primality.

                    <p>
                        In the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, two parties agree on a shared secret by 
                        exchanging values in a cyclic group \(G = \langle g \rangle\) of order \(n\). 
                        The security relies on the <strong>discrete logarithm problem (DLP)</strong>: 
                        given \(g\) and \(h = g^x\), find the exponent \(x\).

                        Lagrange's Theorem reveals a critical vulnerability when \(n\) is composite. 
                        The <strong>Pohlig-Hellman algorithm</strong> exploits the subgroup structure 
                        guaranteed by Lagrange's Theorem to reduce the DLP in \(G\) to smaller DLPs in 
                        subgroups of prime-power order.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Key Insight:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Suppose \(n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}\). For each prime power \(p_i^{e_i}\) 
                        dividing \(n\), consider the element
                        \[
                        g_i = g^{n / p_i^{e_i}}.
                        \]
                        By Lagrange's Theorem, \(g_i\) has order exactly \(p_i^{e_i}\) since
                        \[
                        (g_i)^{p_i^{e_i}} = g^n = e \quad \text{and} \quad (g_i)^{p_i^{e_i - 1}} = g^{n/p_i} \neq e.
                        \]
                        Similarly, define \(h_i = h^{n / p_i^{e_i}}\). Then
                        \[
                        h_i = (g^x)^{n / p_i^{e_i}} = (g_i)^x,
                        \]
                        so solving \(h_i = (g_i)^{x_i}\) for \(x_i\) is a DLP in a subgroup of order \(p_i^{e_i}\), 
                        which yields \(x_i \equiv x \bmod{p_i^{e_i}}\).
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Reconstructing the Solution:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Once we have all \(k\) congruences
                        \[
                        x \equiv x_1 \bmod{p_1^{e_1}}, \quad x \equiv x_2 \bmod{p_2^{e_2}}, \quad \ldots, \quad x \equiv x_k \bmod{p_k^{e_k}},
                        \]
                        the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees a unique solution modulo \(n\).
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Complexity Implication:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The complexity of the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm is 
                        \[
                        O\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} e_i \left(\log n + \sqrt{p_i}\right)\right)
                        \]
                        group operations. When all prime factors \(p_i\) are small (i.e., \(n\) is <strong>smooth</strong>), 
                        this is dramatically faster than the \(O(\sqrt{n})\) complexity of generic algorithms like 
                        baby-step giant-step. For example, if \(n = 2^{20}\), the DLP can be solved in roughly 
                        \(O(20 \cdot (\log n + \sqrt{2})) \approx O(20 \cdot 21.4)\) operations instead of 
                        \(O(\sqrt{2^{20}}) = O(1024)\) operations.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Defense:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        This is precisely why cryptographic protocols choose groups of <strong>prime order \(p\)</strong>. 
                        By Lagrange's theorem, such groups have no nontrivial proper subgroups, rendering 
                        Pohlig-Hellman inapplicable and forcing attackers to confront the full difficulty of the DLP. 
                        We hope you can see the fundamental connection between abstract algebra and computer science.

                <p>
                  As we mentioned in the Cosets section, in general, it is <strong>NOT</strong> true that \(\forall a \in G, \, aH = Ha\) 
                  for a subgroup \(H\) of a group \(G\). However, there are special and important situations where this statement hold. 
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Normal Subgroups</span>  
                    A subgroup \(H\) of a group \(G\) is said to be a <strong>normal subgroup</strong> of \(G\) if 
                    \[
                    \forall a \in G, \, aH = Ha
                    \]
                    denoted by \(H \vartriangleleft G\).
                </div>   

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Normal Subgroup Test</span>  
                    A subgroup \(H\) of \(G\) is normal in \(G\) if and only if 
                    \[
                    \forall x \in G, \, x H x^{-1} \subseteq H.
                    \]

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof: </span>
                    If \(H\) is normal in \(G\), then for any \(x \in G\) and \(h \in H\) there is an 
                    \(h' \in H\) such that \(xh = h'x\). Thus, 
                    \[
                    xhx^{-1} = h', \, xHx^{-1} \subseteq H.
                    \]
                    Conversely, if \\forall x, \, (xHx^{-1} \subseteq H\), then letting \(x = a\), we have 
                    \[
                    aHa^{-1} \subseteq H \text{ or } aH \subseteq Ha.
                    \]
                    On the other hand, letting \(x = a^{-1}\), we have 
                    \[
                    a^{-1}H(a^{-1})^{-1} = a^{-1}Ha \subseteq H \text{ or } Ha \subseteq aH.
                    \]
