                <h2>Cosets: Partitioning the Group</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Up to this point, we have treated groups as individual, isolated objects. We have explored the 
                    "internal clockwork" of cyclic groups and the "shuffling" mechanics of symmetric groups. However, 
                    the true power of group theory lies in <strong>structural analysis</strong> - understanding how groups 
                    relate to one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this page, we shift our focus from "What is a group?" to "How do groups map to each other?" 
                    We will develop the tools to partition groups into meaningful blocks (cosets), simplify complex 
                    groups into smaller "quotient" structures, and prove that seemingly different groups are actually 
                    identical in structure (isomorphism).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In computer science, we often use equivalence relations to categorize data into buckets. 
                    In group theory, <strong>cosets</strong> serve a similar purpose. Given a subgroup \( H \), 
                    we can use it to "slice" the parent group \( G \) into disjoint pieces of equal size.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Cosets</span>  
                    Let \(H\) be a nonempty subset of a group \(G\).  For any \(a \in G\), we define:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    aH &= \{ah \mid h \in H\} (\text{ The left coset of } H \text{ in } G \text{ containing } a. ), \\\\
                    Ha &= \{ha \mid h \in H\} (\text{ The right coset of } H \text{ in } G \text{ containing } a. ), \\\\
                    aHa^{-1} &= \{aha^{-1} \mid h \in H\}. 
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    The element \(a\) is called the <strong>coset representative</strong> of \(aH\) (or \(Ha\)). 
                    <br>
                    We denote \(|aH|\) (or \(Ha\)) as the  number of elements in the set \(aH\) (or \(Ha\)).

                        Consider the additive group of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) and its subgroup 
                        \[

                        \] 
                        To find the cosets, we pick an element \( a \in \mathbb{Z} \) and add it to every element in \( H \):

                        This illustrates that the cosets are exactly the <strong>equivalence classes</strong> of the "modulo" relation. 
                        In CS terms, this is the mathematical foundation of a hash map where the keys are remainders.

                    The following properties define how cosets behave as the "building blocks" of a group. 
                    These properties establish that cosets aren't just random subsets, but a highly structured partition.

                    From a structural perspective, <strong>Property 3</strong> implies that a coset is <strong>uniquely determined</strong> 
                    by any one of its elements (any element can act as a "representative"). <strong>Property 4</strong> ensures that these 
                    cosets never partially overlap. Combining these with <strong>Property 6</strong>, we arrive at a powerful conclusion: 
                    the left (or right) cosets of \(H\) <strong>partition \(G\) into disjoint blocks of equal size</strong>. In Computer Science, 
                    this is the exact behavior of an <strong>equivalence relation</strong> used in partitioning algorithms.

                <h2>Lagrange's Theorem</h2>
                
                <p>
                    The properties of cosets we have just explored lead to one of the most fundamental results in finite group theory. 
                    If cosets partition a group into disjoint blocks of equal size, then the total number of elements in the group must 
                    be a simple multiple of the size of any of its subgroups. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, this theorem imposes a rigid "divisibility constraint" on the structure of finite groups: 
                    a subgroup cannot just be any size; its order must be a divisor of the parent group's order.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Lagrange's Theorem</span>  
                    <p>
                        If \(H\) is a subgroup of a finite group \(G\), then \(|H|\) divides \(|G|\). Moreover, 
                        the number of distinct left (or right) cosets of \(H\) in \(G\) is \(|G| / |H|\).
                    </p>
                </div>   

                <div class="proof">

                        Let \(a_1 H, \, a_2 H, \, \ldots, \, a_r H\) denote the distinct left cosets of \(H\) in \(G\).
                        For any \(a \in G\), Property 1 guarantees that \(a \in aH\). Since the cosets \(a_1 H, \ldots, a_r H\) 
                        exhaust all distinct cosets, we have \(aH = a_i H\) for some \(i\), which means \(a \in a_i H\). 
                        Therefore, every element of \(G\) belongs to one of these cosets:
                        \[
                        G = a_1 H \cup \cdots \cup a_r H.
                        \]
                        By Property 4, this union is disjoint, so:
                        \[
                        |G| = |a_1 H| + |a_2 H| + \cdots + |a_r H|.
                        \]
                        Since \(\forall i, \, |a_i H| = |H|\) by Property 6, we have \(|G| = r |H|\).
                        Therefore, 
                        \[
                        r = \frac{|G|}{|H|}.
                        \]

                        By the division algorithm:

                        result is trivial, we assume that \(r \in U(p)\). (Note that \(U(p) = \{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}\) under

                        Lagrange's Theorem reveals a critical vulnerability when \(n\) is composite. 
                        The <strong>Pohlig-Hellman algorithm</strong> exploits the subgroup structure 
                        guaranteed by Lagrange's Theorem to reduce the DLP in \(G\) to smaller DLPs in

                    <p>
                        Suppose \(n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}\). For each prime power \(p_i^{e_i}\) 
                        dividing \(n\), consider the element
                        \[
                        g_i = g^{n / p_i^{e_i}}.
                        \]
                        By Lagrange's Theorem, \(g_i\) has order exactly \(p_i^{e_i}\) since
                        \[
                        (g_i)^{p_i^{e_i}} = g^n = e \quad \text{and} \quad (g_i)^{p_i^{e_i - 1}} = g^{n/p_i} \neq e.
                        \]
                        Similarly, define \(h_i = h^{n / p_i^{e_i}}\). Then
                        \[
                        h_i = (g^x)^{n / p_i^{e_i}} = (g_i)^x,
                        \]
                        so solving \(h_i = (g_i)^{x_i}\) for \(x_i\) is a DLP in a subgroup of order \(p_i^{e_i}\), 
                        which yields \(x_i \equiv x \bmod{p_i^{e_i}}\).

                        Once we have all \(k\) congruences
                        \[
                        x \equiv x_1 \bmod{p_1^{e_1}}, \quad x \equiv x_2 \bmod{p_2^{e_2}}, \quad \ldots, \quad x \equiv x_k \bmod{p_k^{e_k}},

                        The complexity of the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm is

                        O\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} e_i \left(\log n + \sqrt{p_i}\right)\right)

                        group operations. When all prime factors \(p_i\) are small (i.e., \(n\) is <strong>smooth</strong>), 
                        this is dramatically faster than the \(O(\sqrt{n})\) complexity of generic algorithms like 
                        baby-step giant-step. For example, if \(n = 2^{20}\), the DLP can be solved in roughly 
                        \(O(20 \cdot (\log n + \sqrt{2})) \approx O(20 \cdot 21.4)\) operations instead of 
                        \(O(\sqrt{2^{20}}) = O(1024)\) operations.

                        This is precisely why cryptographic protocols choose groups of <strong>prime order \(p\)</strong>. 
                        By Lagrange's theorem, such groups have no nontrivial proper subgroups, rendering 
                        Pohlig-Hellman inapplicable and forcing attackers to confront the full difficulty of the DLP. 
                        We hope you can see the fundamental connection between abstract algebra and computer science.

                <p>
                    We have seen that any subgroup \(H\) partitions \(G\) into cosets. However, the left coset \(aH\) and right coset \(Ha\) are 
                    not always identical. This 'mismatch' implies that a product of cosets would depend on our choice of representatives, rendering 
                    the group operation ill-defined. To ensure the operation remains well-defined - and thus independent of the representative - we 
                    require a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation. This special structure is known as a <strong>normal subgroup</strong>.

                <h2>Factor Groups (Quotient Groups)</h2>

                 <p>
                    We have seen that a normal subgroup \(H\) satisfies \(aH = Ha\) for all \(a \in G\), 
                    ensuring that left and right cosets coincide. This property is not merely a curiosity — it 
                    is precisely the condition required to define a consistent group operation on the set of cosets. 
                    With normality in hand, we can now "collapse" a group into a simpler structure by treating 
                    entire cosets as single elements.
                </p>

                 <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Factor Groups</span>  
                    Let \(G\) be a group and let \(H\) be a normal subgroup of \(G\). The set of cosets:
                    \[
                    G / H = \{aH \mid a \in G\}
                    \]
                    forms a group under the operation: 
                    \[
                    (aH)(bH) = (ab)H.
                    \]
                    This group is called the <strong>factor group</strong> (or quotient group) of \(G\) by \(H\).
                    The size of this group is \(|G/H| = |G|/|H|\).

                    <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                    First, to show that the operation is well-defined, we check if the following function is valid or not: 
                    \[
                    (G / H) \times (G / H) \to G / H.
                    \]
                    Suppose \(aH = a'H\) and \(bH = b'H\) for some elements \(a, a', b, b' \in G\). 
                    We must show that \(abH = a'b'H\).
                    <br>
                    From the assumption: \(aH = a'H \text{ and } bH = b'H \), we have
                    \(a' = ah_1\) and \(b' = bh_2\) for some \(h_1, h_2 \in H\).
                    Here, by Property 2 of Properties of Cosets and \(H \vartriangleleft G\), we have:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    a'b'H &= (ah_1)(bh_2) H \\\\
                          &= ah_1 b H \\\\
                          &= ah_1 H b \\\\
                          &= aHb \\\\
                          &= abH.
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    Therefore, the operation is well-defined. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now, we check group axioms for \(G / H\):

                        The factor group operation tells us how to add these cosets:

                        Define a map \(\phi: \mathbb{Z} \to G_2\) based on whether a number is even or odd:
                        \[
                        \phi(n) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\ -1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \end{cases}
                        \]
                        Is this a homomorphism? We check if \(\phi(a + b) = \phi(a)\phi(b)\).

                        Since the equation holds for all cases, \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. It "translates" the logic of addition into 
                        multiplication without breaking the truth of the statements.

                    Property 5 (The \(n\)-to-1 Mapping) states that when \(|\text{Ker }\phi| = n\), exactly \(n\) elements of \(G\) 
                    map to each element in the image \(\phi(G)\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    To see why, recall Property 6 of Elements under Homomorphism: if \(\phi(g) = \overline{g}\), then
                    \[
                    \phi^{-1}(\overline{g}) = \{x \in G \mid \phi(x) = \overline{g}\} = g \text{Ker } \phi.
                    \]
                    This tells us that the set of all elements mapping to \(\overline{g}\) is precisely the coset \(g \text{Ker } \phi\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    By Property 6 of Cosets, all cosets have the same number of elements. 
                    Since \(e \text{Ker } \phi = \text{Ker } \phi\) is itself a coset, we have:
                    \[
                    |\phi^{-1}(\overline{g})| = |g \text{Ker } \phi| = |\text{Ker } \phi| = n.
                    \]
                    Therefore, for every element \(\overline{g} \in \phi(G)\), there are exactly \(n\) elements in \(G\) 
                    that map to \(\overline{g}\) (aka preimages).

                <p>
                    If \(H\) is finite, then \(\phi\) restricted to \(H\) is an \(m\)-to-1 mapping where \(m = |H \cap \text{Ker }\phi|\). 
                    By counting:
                    \[
                    |H| = m \cdot |\phi(H)| \implies |\phi(H)| = \frac{|H|}{m},
                    \]

                    An <strong>isomorphism</strong> \(\phi\) from a group \(G\) to a group \(\overline{G}\) is a one-to-one and onto

                        <strong>2. The Homomorphism:</strong><br>
                        Define \(\Phi: G \to S_G\) by \(\Phi(g) = \lambda_g\). Does it preserve the operation?
                        Consider the composition of two permutations \(\lambda_a\) and \(\lambda_b\):
                        \[
                        (\lambda_a \circ \lambda_b)(x) = \lambda_a(\lambda_b(x)) = \lambda_a(bx) = a(bx) = (ab)x = \lambda_{ab}(x)
                        \]
                        Thus, \(\Phi(a)\Phi(b) = \Phi(ab)\).

                        <strong>3. One-to-One (Injective):</strong><br>
                        If \(\Phi(a) = \Phi(b)\), then \(\lambda_a = \lambda_b\). This means for all \(x\), \(ax = bx\).
                        Letting \(x = e\), we get \(ae = be \implies a = b\).
                        <br>
                        Since \(\Phi\) is an injective homomorphism, \(G\) is isomorphic to its image in \(S_G\).

                    Let \(\phi\) be a group homomorphism from \(G\) to \(\overline{G}\). Then the mapping from \(G / \text{Ker }\phi\) 
                    to \(\phi(G)\), given by \(g \text{Ker } \phi \to \phi(g)\), is an isomorphism. In symbols, 
                    \[
                    G / \text{Ker } \phi \cong \phi(G).
                    \]

                <p>
                    The First Isomorphism Theorem is the "Grand Unification" of this chapter. 
                    It says that <strong>every homomorphism is essentially a factor group construction.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we map \(G \to \overline{G}\) via \(\phi\), we are implicitly doing three things:
                    <ol style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li><strong>Collapsing:</strong> identifying all elements of \(\text{Ker }\phi\) as the identity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Partitioning:</strong> grouping the elements of \(G\) into cosets of \(\text{Ker }\phi\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Relabeling:</strong> matching each coset to its corresponding element in \(\phi(G)\).</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mathematically, this means the quotient \(G/\text{Ker }\phi\) is isomorphic to the image \(\phi(G)\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    we immediately obtain following corollaries from TFIT.

                        If \(\phi\) is a homomorphism from a finite group \(G\) to \(\overline{G}\), then 
                        <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                            <li>\(|G| / |\text{Ker } \phi | = | \phi(G) |\).</li>
                            <li>\(|\phi(G)|\) divides \(|G|\) and \(|\overline{G}|\).</li>

                    <p>
                        Recall the natural projection \(\phi: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_n\) defined by 
                        \(\phi(m) = m \bmod n\), whose kernel is \(\text{Ker }\phi = \langle n \rangle\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the First Isomorphism Theorem:
                        \[
                        \mathbb{Z} / \langle n \rangle \cong \phi(\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}_n.
                        \]
                        This confirms that the factor group \(\mathbb{Z}/\langle n \rangle = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\) 
                        and the cyclic group \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) are structurally identical.
