                <h2>Cosets: Partitioning the Group</h2>
                <p>
                    Up to this point, we have treated groups as individual, isolated objects. We have explored the 
                    "internal clockwork" of cyclic groups and the "shuffling" mechanics of symmetric groups. However, 
                    the true power of group theory lies in <strong>structural analysis</strong> - understanding how groups 
                    relate to one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this page, we shift our focus from "What is a group?" to "How do groups map to each other?" 
                    We will develop the tools to partition groups into meaningful blocks (cosets), simplify complex 
                    groups into smaller "quotient" structures, and prove that seemingly different groups are actually 
                    identical in structure (isomorphism).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In computer science, we often use equivalence relations to categorize data into buckets. 
                    In group theory, <strong>cosets</strong> serve a similar purpose. Given a subgroup \( H \), 
                    we can use it to "slice" the parent group \( G \) into disjoint pieces of equal size.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Cosets</span>  
                    Let \(H\) be a nonempty subset of a group \(G\).  For any \(a \in G\), we define:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    aH &= \{ah \mid h \in H\} (\text{ The left coset of } H \text{ in } G \text{ containing } a. ), \\\\
                    Ha &= \{ha \mid h \in H\} (\text{ The right coset of } H \text{ in } G \text{ containing } a. ), \\\\
                    aHa^{-1} &= \{aha^{-1} \mid h \in H\}. 
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    The element \(a\) is called the <strong>coset representative</strong> of \(aH\) (or \(Ha\)). 
                    <br>
                    We denote \(|aH|\) (or \(Ha\)) as the  number of elements in the set \(aH\) (or \(Ha\)).
                </div>


                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Example: The "Clock" Partition (\( 3\mathbb{Z} \) in \( \mathbb{Z} \))</span>
                    <p>
                        Consider the additive group of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) and its subgroup 
                        \[
                        H = 3\mathbb{Z} = \{ \dots, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, \dots \}. 
                        \] 
                        To find the cosets, we pick an element \( a \in \mathbb{Z} \) and add it to every element in \( H \):
                    </p>
                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li><strong>0 + 3\(\mathbb{Z}\)</strong> = { \(\cdots\), -6, -3,  0,  3,  6, \(\cdots\) }</li>
                        <li><strong>1 + 3\(\mathbb{Z}\)</strong> = { \(\cdots\), -5, -2,  1,  4,  7, \(\cdots\) }</li>
                        <li><strong>2 + 3\(\mathbb{Z}\)</strong> = { \(\cdots\), -4, -1,  2,  5,  8, \(\cdots\) }</li>
                        <li><strong>3 + 3\(\mathbb{Z}\)</strong> = { \(\cdots\), -3,  0,  3,  6,  9, \(\cdots\) } = <strong>0 + 3\(\mathbb{Z}\)</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        This illustrates that the cosets are exactly the <strong>equivalence classes</strong> of the "modulo" relation. 
                        In CS terms, this is the mathematical foundation of a hash map where the keys are remainders.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The following properties define how cosets behave as the "building blocks" of a group. 
                    These properties establish that cosets aren't just random subsets, but a highly structured partition.
                </p>

                        Let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\), and \(a, b \in G\). Then:

                        <li>\(aH = bH\) if and only if \(a \in bH\).</li>
                        <li>\(aH = bH\) or \(aH \cap bH = \emptyset\).</li>
                        <li>\(aH = bH\) if and only if \(a^{-1}b \in H\).</li>
                        <li>\(|aH| = |bH|\).</li>
                        <li>\(aH = Ha\) if and only if \(H = aHa^{-1}\).</li>
                        <li>\(aH\) is a subgroup of \(G\) if and only if \(a \in H\).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Note: Corresponding properties hold for right cosets as well.

                <p>
                    From a structural perspective, <strong>Property 3</strong> implies that a coset is <strong>uniquely determined</strong> 
                    by any one of its elements (any element can act as a "representative"). <strong>Property 4</strong> ensures that these 
                    cosets never partially overlap. Combining these with <strong>Property 6</strong>, we arrive at a powerful conclusion: 
                    the left (or right) cosets of \(H\) <strong>partition \(G\) into disjoint blocks of equal size</strong>. In Computer Science, 
                    this is the exact behavior of an <strong>equivalence relation</strong> used in partitioning algorithms.
