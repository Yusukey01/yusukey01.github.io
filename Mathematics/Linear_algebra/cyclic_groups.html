                <p>
                    In <a href="intro_groups.html"><strong>Intro to Abstract Algebra</strong></a>, we established the 
                    foundational group axioms and core structural concepts like Abelian groups and subgroups. In this page, 
                    we pivot from general concepts to specific examples of finite groups, which are crucial building blocks 
                    of abstract algebra.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We start with a fundamental finite cyclic group. 
                    (By the way, <strong>every cyclic group is Abelian.</strong>
                     You can check this fact from definition of cyclic groups and Abelian groups. The key is 
                     commutativity: \(a^m a^n = a^{m+n} = a^{n+m} = a^n a^m\). Note that the converse of this 
                     statement is NOT true.)
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Group of Integers Modulo \(n\):</span> 
                    The set 
                    \[
                    \mathbb{Z}_n = \{0, 1, \cdots, n-2, n-1\}, \, (n \geq 1)
                    \]
                    is a finite <strong>cyclic</strong> group under addition modulo \(n\). For any \(k > 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}_n\), the 
                    inverse of the element \(k\) is \(n - k\).  The identity is \(0\). 
                </div>

                <p>
                    For example, consider: 
                    \[
                    \mathbb{Z}_8 = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}.
                    \]
                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>\(1\) (Generator):</li>
                        \[
                        \langle 1 \rangle = \{1, 1+1, 1+1+1, \cdots,\} (\bmod 8)
                        \]
                        Thus, we have: 
                        \[
                        \langle 1 \rangle = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0\} = \mathbb{Z}_8
                        \]

                        <br><li>\(3\) (Generator):</li>
                        \[
                        \langle 3 \rangle = \{3, 3+3, 6+3, 9+3, \cdots \} (\bmod 8)
                        \]
                        Thus, we have: 
                        \[
                        \langle 3 \rangle = \{3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 0 \} = \mathbb{Z}_8
                        \]

                        <br><li>\(5\) (Generator):</li>
                        \[
                        \langle 5 \rangle = \{5, 5+5, 10+5, 15+5, \cdots \} (\bmod 8)
                        \]
                        Thus, we have: 
                        \[
                        \langle 5 \rangle = \{5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 0 \} = \mathbb{Z}_8
                        \]

                        <br><li>\(7\) (Generator):</li>
                        \[
                        \langle 7 \rangle = \{7, 7+7, 14+7, 21+7, \cdots \} (\bmod 8)
                        \]
                        Thus, we have: 
                        \[
                        \langle 7 \rangle = \{7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 \} = \mathbb{Z}_8
                        \]
                    </ul>
                    Thus, \(1, 3, 5, \text{ and } 7) are generators of (\mathbb{Z}_8 \): 
                    \[
                    \mathbb{Z}_8 = \langle 1 \rangle = \langle 3 \rangle = \langle 5 \rangle = \langle 7 \rangle, 
                    \]
                    whereas \(2, 4, \text{ and } 6\) are not generators of \(\mathbb{Z}_8 \). For instance, 
                    \[
                    \langle 2 \rangle = \{2, 2+2, 4+2, 6+2\} (\bmod 8)
                    \]
                    Thus, we have: 
                    \[
                    \langle 2 \rangle = \{2, 4, 6, 0\} \neq \mathbb{Z}_8.
                    \]
                </p>

                <p>
                    In general, the element \(n-1\) is a generator of \(\mathbb{Z}_n \) because it is the unique additive inverse of the generator \(1\). 
                    Remember that in abstract additive notation, the inverse of \(1\) is written as \(-1\). Working in \(\mathbb{Z}_n\), 
                    we define the notation:
                    \[
                    \mathbf{-1} = \mathbf{n-1} \pmod n.
                    \]
                    Thus, for \(\mathbb{Z}_8 \), the two guaranteed generators are \(1\) and \(7\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Indeed, the inverse of any generator of \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) is also always a generator. 
                    This fact is supported by the full classification theorem for generators of \(\mathbb{Z}_n\):
                </p>

                <div class="theorem"> 
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem 1: Generators of \(\mathbb{Z}_n\)</span>
                    An integer \(k \in \mathbb{Z}_n\) is a generator of \(\mathbb{Z}_n\)
                    if and only if \(k\) and \(n\) are relatively prime: 
                    \[
                    \gcd (n, k) = 1. 
                    \]
                </div>

                <p>
                    This fact comes from more general settings. First, we introduce the following theorem:

                    Let \(a\) be an element of order \(n\) in a group, and let \(k\) be a positive integer. Then for 
                    any cyclic group \(\langle a \rangle\) of order \(n\), 
                    \[
                    \langle a^k \rangle = \langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle
                    \]
                    and 
                    \[
                    |a^k| = \frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}.
                    \]
                </div>

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                    Let \(k = \gcd(n, k) \cdot r\). Since \(a^k = (a^{\gcd(n, k)})^r\), we have: 
                    \[
                    \langle a^k \rangle \subseteq \langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle.
                    \]
                    There are integers \(s\) and \(t\) such that 
                    \[
                    \gcd(n, k) = ns + kt
                    \]
                    since the greatest common divisor is a linear combination of two integers. 
                    <br>
                    Thus, we can rewrite \(a^{\gcd(n, k)}\) as following:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    a^{\gcd(n, k)} &= a^{ns+kt} \\\\
                                   &= (a^n)^s (a^k)^t \\\\
                                   &= e (a^k)^t \\\\
                                   &= (a^k)^t \in \langle a^k \rangle.
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    This implies 
                    \[
                     \langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle \subseteq \langle a^k \rangle.
                    \]
                    Therefore, we conclude that 
                    \[
                    \langle a^k \rangle = \langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle.
                    \]
                    For the second part of the theorem, it is clear that 
                    \[
                    (a^{\gcd(n, k)})^{\frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}} = a^n = e.
                    \]
                    So, 
                    \[
                    |a^{\gcd(n, k)}| \leq \frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}.
                    \]
                    Now, consider any positive integer  \(i < \frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}\). 
                    Then the exponent \(\gcd(n, k) i < n\). Since \(|a| = n\), the identity \(e\) cannot be generated by 
                    any positive power of \(a\) strictly less than \(n\). Therefore, 
                    \[
                    (a^{\gcd(n, k)})^i \neq e
                    \]
                    Thus, the smallest positive power to yield the identity \(e\) is exactly \(\frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}\):
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    |a^k| &= |\langle a^k \rangle| \\\\
                          &= |\langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle| \\\\
                          &= | a^{\gcd(n, k)} | \\\\
                          &= \frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}.
                    \end{align*}

                    Suppose a cyclic group \(G = \langle a \rangle\) has order 30. Then we can find subgroups of \(G\) as follows:

                    <p><strong>Part 1:</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        Let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G = \langle a \rangle\). If \(H = \{e\}\), then \(H\) is cyclic. 
                        Assume \(H \neq \{e\}\). 
                        Since \(G = \langle a \rangle\), every element of \(H\) has the form \(a^t\) for some positive integer \(t\).
                        If \(a^t \in H\) with \(t < 0\), then \(a^{-t} = (a^t)^{-1} \in H\), and \(-t\) is positive.
                        Let \(m\) be the <strong>least positive integer</strong> such that \(a^m \in H\).
                        By closure, \(\langle a^m \rangle \subseteq H\). 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We claim that \(H = \langle a^m \rangle\). Let \(b\) be any element in \(H\). 
                        Since \(b \in G\), we have \(b = a^k\) for some integer \(k\).
                        By the Division Algorithm, we can write \(k = mq + r\) where \(0 \leq r < m\).
                        Then:
                        \[
                        a^k = a^{mq+r} = a^{mq}a^r \implies a^r = a^{-mq}a^k.
                        \]
                        Since \(a^k \in H\) and \(a^{-mq} = (a^m)^{-q} \in H\), it follows that \(a^r \in H\). 
                        However, \(m\) is the least positive integer such that \(a^m \in H\) and \(0 \leq r < m\).
                        Thus, \(r\) must be \(0\).
                        Therefore, 
                        \[
                        b = a^k =  a^{mq} = (a^m)^q \in \langle a^m \rangle.
                        \]
                        This implies every element in \(H\) is generated by \(a^m\), and hence \(H = \langle a^m \rangle\). Therefore, 
                        every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
                    </p>
                  
                    <p><strong>Part 2:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Let \(H\) be any subgroup of \(G = \langle a \rangle\), where \(|G| = n\). 
                        From Part 1, \(H = \langle a^m \rangle\), where \(m\) is the least positive integer such that \(a^m \in H\).
                        By Theorem 2, \(a^{\gcd(m, n)} \in \langle a^m \rangle = H\). Since \(\gcd(m,n) \leq m\) and \(m\) is minimal, 
                        we have \(m = \gcd(n,m)\), hence \(m\) divides \(n\). Therefore,
                        \[
                        |H| = |a^m| = \frac{n}{m},
                        \]
                        which divides \(n\). This proves that the order of any subgroup of \(G\) is a divisor of \(n\).
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        Now let \(k\) be any positive divisor of \(n\). Then \(\langle a^{n/k} \rangle\) is a subgroup of order
                        \[
                        |\langle a^{n/k} \rangle | = \frac{n}{\gcd(n, n/k)} = \frac{n}{n/k} = k.
                        \]
                        Suppose \(K\) is any subgroup of \(\langle a \rangle\) of order \(k\).
                        Then \(K\) has the form \(\langle a^s \rangle\), where \(s\) divides \(n\) and 
                        \[
                        |K| = \frac{n}{s} = k \implies s = \frac{n}{k}.
                        \]
                        Thus, \(K = \langle a^{n/k} \rangle\).

                <h2>Permutation Groups</h2>

                <p>
                    Here, we introduce a family of <strong>non-Abelian</strong> groups, namely <strong>permutation groups</strong>. 
                    Remember, a <strong>permutation</strong> of a set \(A\) is a function from \(A\) to itself that is a bijective function 
                    (one-to-one and onto). For example, consider a set \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\). A permutation of \(A\) is essentially an ordered 
                    arrangement of its elements. So, the total number of permutations for \(A\) is given by the factorial \(3! = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6\).
                </p>

                <div class="theorem"> 
                    <span class="theorem-title">Permutation Groups:</span>
                    A <strong>permutation group</strong> of a set \(A\) is a set of permutations of \(A\) that forms a group 
                    under function composition.
                </div>

                
                <p>
                    For example, the permutation group of \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) is the set of all one-to-one functions 
                    from \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) to itself. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To represent these permutations explicitly, we use the two-row matrix notation. In this format, the elements 
                    of the set \(A\) are listed in the top row, and directly below each element is its image (where it is mapped to) 
                    under the permutation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For a permutation \(\sigma\) on a set of \(n\) elements, the notation is structured as follows:
                    \[
                    \sigma = \begin{bmatrix} i_{1} & i_{2} & \cdots & i_{n} \\\\
                                            \sigma(i_{1}) & \sigma(i_{2}) & \cdots & \sigma(i_{n}) 
                             \end{bmatrix}
                    \]
                    This means the element \(i_k\) in the top row maps to the element \(\sigma(i_k)\) directly beneath it. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The elements of \(S_3\) are expressed using this notation as follows:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    \epsilon &= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\  1 & 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} , \quad  \alpha = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\  2 & 3 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \\\\
                    \alpha^2 &= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\  3 & 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} , \quad  \beta = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\  1 & 3 & 2 \end{bmatrix}, \\\\
                    \alpha \beta &= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\  2 & 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix} , \quad \alpha^2 \beta = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\  3 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    This group is called the <strong>symmetric group</strong> of degree \(3\) and is denoted by \(S_3\). 
                    The order of this group is given by \(|S_3| = 3! = 6.\) In general, we define the symmetric group as follows: 
                </p>

                    degree \(n\) and is denoted by \(S_n\). Elements of this group are written by:

                    Let \(S\) be the finite set on which \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) act. Since the cycles are disjoint, 
                    the set \(S\) can be partitioned into three mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsets:

                        <li>\(A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m\}\), the set of elements moved by \(\alpha\).</li>

                    </ol>

                    To prove that the permutations are equal, we must show that the result of applying the compositions 
                    \(\alpha \beta\) and \(\beta \alpha\) is identical:
                    \[
                     \forall x \in S, \, (\alpha \beta)(x) = (\beta \alpha)(x).
                    \]

                    <p><strong>Case 1: \(x \in A\) (The element is moved by \(\alpha\))</strong></p>
                    Since \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, \(\beta\) must fix every element in \(A\). Thus, \(\beta(x) = x\).
                    <br>
                    For the composition \(\alpha \beta\):
                    \[
                    (\alpha \beta)(x) = \alpha(\beta (x)) = \alpha(x).
                    \]
                    Since \(x \in A\), \(\alpha(x)\) is also in \(A\). Because \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, \(\beta\) fixes \(\alpha(x)\).
                    <br>
                    For the composition \(\beta \alpha\):

                    (\beta \alpha)(x) = \beta (\alpha (x)) = \alpha (x).
                    \]
                    Thus, for \(x \in A\), \((\alpha \beta)(x) = \alpha(x) = (\beta \alpha)(x)\).

                    <p><strong>Case 2: \(x \in B\) (The element is moved by \(\beta\))</strong></p>

                    <br>
                    For the composition \(\alpha \beta\):

                    Since \(x \in B\), \(\beta(x) \in B\). Because \(B\) and \(A\) are disjoint, \(\alpha\) fixes \(\beta(x)\). Therefore,
                    \[
                    (\alpha \beta)(x) = \beta (x).
                    \]

                    Let \(\alpha\) be a permutation and its disjoint cycle decomposition be:
                    \[
                    \alpha = \beta_1 \beta_2 \ldots \beta_r
                    \]
                    where \(\beta_i\) is a cycle of length \(k_i\). We recall that the order of a \(k_i\)-cycle is \(|\beta_i| = k_i\).
                    We must show that \(|\alpha| = \text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_r) = m\).

                    <p>Show that \(\alpha^m = \epsilon\):</strong></p>
                    Since the cycles \(\beta_i\) are disjoint, they commute with each other (by Theorem 6). Therefore, for any positive integer \(t\):
                    \[
                    \alpha^t = (\beta_1 \beta_2 \ldots \beta_r)^t = \beta_1^t \beta_2^t \ldots \beta_r^t.
                    \]
                    By the definition of the least common multiple, \(m\) is a multiple of each \(k_i\). 
                    Since \(|\beta_i| = k_i\), we have \(\beta_i^m = \epsilon\) for every \(i\).
                    It follows that:
                    \[
                    \alpha^m = \epsilon \cdot \epsilon \cdots \epsilon = \epsilon.
                    \]
                    By the properties of group element orders, this implies that 
                    the order \(|\alpha|\) must divide \(m\), and thus \(|\alpha| \leq m\).

                    <p><strong>Show that \(m\) is the smallest such positive integer:</strong></p>
                    Suppose \(\alpha^t = \epsilon\) for some positive integer \(t\). This means:
                    \[
                    \beta_1^t \beta_2^t \cdots \beta_r^t = \epsilon.
                    \]
                    Since the cycles are disjoint, each \(\beta_i\) moves a disjoint set of elements. 
                    For any element \(x\) moved by the cycle \(\beta_i\), the other cycles \(\beta_j\) (\(j \neq i\)) fix \(x\).
                    Applying the permutation to such an \(x\), we get:
                    \[
                    \alpha^t(x) = \beta_i^t(x) = x.
                    \]
                    Since this holds for all \(x\) in the support of \(\beta_i\), we must have \(\beta_i^t = \epsilon\).
                    From the properties of cyclic groups, \(\beta_i^t = \epsilon\) implies that the order \(k_i\) divides \(t\). 
                    <br><br>
                    Because this must hold for every \(i \in \{1, \ldots, r\}\), \(t\) must be a common multiple of all cycle lengths \(k_1, \ldots, k_r\).
                    By definition, the least common multiple \(m\) is the smallest such integer. Thus, \(t \geq m\).

                    <p>We conclude that \(|\alpha| = m = \text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_r)\).</p>

                    The disjoint cycle factorization is:

                    The order of \(\alpha\) is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the cycle lengths:

                    Every permutation can be uniquely factored into a product of disjoint cycles, and subsequently, 
                    decomposed into a product of 2-cycles (<strong>transpositions</strong>). This decomposition, 
                    though NOT unique in the specific transpositions used, leads us to the concept 
                    of permutation parity. A key theorem guarantees the invariance of this property: the number of 2-cycles 
                    in any factorization of a given permutation will always be consistently even or consistently odd. 
                    This fundamental distinction establishes the alternating Group (\(A_n\)) as a crucial normal subgroup of 
                    the symmetric Group (\(S_n\)), which plays an important role in Galois theory and the determination of 
                    the solvability of polynomial equations.

                    <li><strong>Odd Permutation (\(\alpha\) in \(S_5\)):</strong>
                    The permutation \(\alpha = (1\, 2\, 3)(4\, 5)\) is decomposed as:
                    \[
                    \alpha = (1\, 3)(1\, 2) \cdot (4\, 5)
                    \]
                    This is a product of \(r = 3\) two-cycles. Since \(3\) is an odd number, \(\alpha\) is an **odd permutation**.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Even Permutation (\(\gamma\) in \(S_5\)):</strong>
                    Consider the 3-cycle \(\gamma = (1\, 2\, 3)\). It is decomposed as:
                    \[
                    \gamma = (1\, 3)(1\, 2)
                    \]
                    This is a product of \(r = 2\) two-cycles. Since \(2\) is an even number, \(\gamma\) is an **even permutation**.
                    (Note: Any cycle of odd length is an even permutation.)

                    The symmetric group \(S_4\) has \(|S_4| = 4! = 24\) elements.
                    The alternating group \(A_4\) (the set of all even permutations in \(S_4\)) has order:
                    \[
                    |A_4| = \frac{|S_4|}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
