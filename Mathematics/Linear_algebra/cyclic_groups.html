                <p>
                    In <a href="intro_groups.html"><strong>Intro to Abstract Algebra</strong></a>, we established the 
                    foundational group axioms and core structural concepts like Abelian groups and subgroups. In this page, 
                    we pivot from general concepts to specific examples of finite groups, which are crucial building blocks 
                    of abstract algebra.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We start with a fundamental finite cyclic group. 
                    (By the way, <strong>every cyclic group is Abelian.</strong>
                     You can check this fact from definition of cyclic groups and Abelian groups. The key is 
                     commutativity: \(a^m a^n = a^{m+n} = a^{n+m} = a^n a^m\). Note that the converse of this 
                     statement is NOT true.)
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Group of Integers Modulo \(n\):</span> 
                    The set 
                    \[
                    \mathbb{Z}_n = \{0, 1, \cdots, n-2, n-1\}, \, (n \geq 1)
                    \]
                    is a finite <strong>cyclic</strong> group under addition modulo \(n\). For any \(k > 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}_n\), the 
                    inverse of the element \(k\) is \(n - k\).  The identity is \(0\). 
                </div>

                <p>
                    For example, consider: 
                    \[
                    \mathbb{Z}_8 = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}.
                    \]
                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>\(1\) (Generator):</li>
                        \[
                        \langle 1 \rangle = \{1, 1+1, 1+1+1, \cdots,\} (\bmod 8)
                        \]
                        Thus, we have: 
                        \[
                        \langle 1 \rangle = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0\} = \mathbb{Z}_8
                        \]

                        <br><li>\(3\) (Generator):</li>
                        \[
                        \langle 3 \rangle = \{3, 3+3, 6+3, 9+3, \cdots \} (\bmod 8)
                        \]
                        Thus, we have: 
                        \[
                        \langle 3 \rangle = \{3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 0 \} = \mathbb{Z}_8
                        \]

                        <br><li>\(5\) (Generator):</li>
                        \[
                        \langle 5 \rangle = \{5, 5+5, 10+5, 15+5, \cdots \} (\bmod 8)
                        \]
                        Thus, we have: 
                        \[
                        \langle 5 \rangle = \{5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 0 \} = \mathbb{Z}_8
                        \]

                        <br><li>\(7\) (Generator):</li>
                        \[
                        \langle 7 \rangle = \{7, 7+7, 14+7, 21+7, \cdots \} (\bmod 8)
                        \]
                        Thus, we have: 
                        \[
                        \langle 7 \rangle = \{7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 \} = \mathbb{Z}_8
                        \]
                    </ul>
                    Thus, \(1, 3, 5, \text{ and } 7) are generators of (\mathbb{Z}_8 \): 
                    \[
                    \mathbb{Z}_8 = \langle 1 \rangle = \langle 3 \rangle = \langle 5 \rangle = \langle 7 \rangle, 
                    \]
                    whereas \(2, 4, \text{ and } 6\) are not generators of \(\mathbb{Z}_8 \). For instance, 
                    \[
                    \langle 2 \rangle = \{2, 2+2, 4+2, 6+2\} (\bmod 8)
                    \]
                    Thus, we have: 
                    \[
                    \langle 2 \rangle = \{2, 4, 6, 0\} \neq \mathbb{Z}_8.
                    \]
                </p>

                <p>
                    In general, the element \(n-1\) is a generator of \(\mathbb{Z}_n \) because it is the unique additive inverse of the generator \(1\). 
                    Remember that in abstract additive notation, the inverse of \(1\) is written as \(-1\). Working in \(\mathbb{Z}_n\), 
                    we define the notation:
                    \[
                    \mathbf{-1} = \mathbf{n-1} \pmod n.
                    \]
                    Thus, for \(\mathbb{Z}_8 \), the two guaranteed generators are \(1\) and \(7\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Indeed, the inverse of any generator of \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) is also always a generator. 
                    This fact is supported by the full classification theorem for generators of \(\mathbb{Z}_n\):
                </p>

                <div class="theorem"> 
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem 1: Generators of \(\mathbb{Z}_n\)</span>
                    An integer \(k \in \mathbb{Z}_n\) is a generator of \(\mathbb{Z}_n\)
                    if and only if \(k\) and \(n\) are relatively prime: 
                    \[
                    \gcd (n, k) = 1. 
                    \]
                </div>

                <p>
                    This fact comes from more general settings. First, we introduce the following theorem:

                    Let \(a\) be an element of order \(n\) in a group, and let \(k\) be a positive integer. Then for 
                    any cyclic group \(\langle a \rangle\) of order \(n\), 
                    \[
                    \langle a^k \rangle = \langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle
                    \]
                    and 
                    \[
                    |a^k| = \frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}.
                    \]
                </div>

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                    Let \(k = \gcd(n, k) \cdot r\). Since \(a^k = (a^{\gcd(n, k)})^r\), we have: 
                    \[
                    \langle a^k \rangle \subseteq \langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle.
                    \]
                    There are integers \(s\) and \(t\) such that 
                    \[
                    \gcd(n, k) = ns + kt
                    \]
                    since the greatest common divisor is a linear combination of two integers. 
                    <br>
                    Thus, we can rewrite \(a^{\gcd(n, k)}\) as following:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    a^{\gcd(n, k)} &= a^{ns+kt} \\\\
                                   &= (a^n)^s (a^k)^t \\\\
                                   &= e (a^k)^t \\\\
                                   &= (a^k)^t \in \langle a^k \rangle.
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    This implies 
                    \[
                     \langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle \subseteq \langle a^k \rangle.
                    \]
                    Therefore, we conclude that 
                    \[
                    \langle a^k \rangle = \langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle.
                    \]
                    For the second part of the theorem, it is clear that 
                    \[
                    (a^{\gcd(n, k)})^{\frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}} = a^n = e.
                    \]
                    So, 
                    \[
                    |a^{\gcd(n, k)}| \leq \frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}.
                    \]
                    Now, consider any positive integer  \(i < \frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}\). 
                    Then the exponent \(\gcd(n, k) i < n\). Since \(|a| = n\), the identity \(e\) cannot be generated by 
                    any positive power of \(a\) strictly less than \(n\). Therefore, 
                    \[
                    (a^{\gcd(n, k)})^i \neq e
                    \]
                    Thus, the smallest positive power to yield the identity \(e\) is exactly \(\frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}\):
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    |a^k| &= |\langle a^k \rangle| \\\\
                          &= |\langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle| \\\\
                          &= | a^{\gcd(n, k)} | \\\\
                          &= \frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)}.
                    \end{align*}
                    \]

                    <p><strong>Part 1:</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        Let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G = \langle a \rangle\). If \(H = \{e\}\), then \(H\) is cyclic. 
                        Assume \(H \neq \{e\}\). 
                        Since \(G = \langle a \rangle\), every element of \(H\) has the form \(a^t\) for some positive integer \(t\).
                        If \(a^t \in H\) with \(t < 0\), then \(a^{-t} = (a^t)^{-1} \in H\), and \(-t\) is positive.
                        Let \(m\) be the <strong>least positive integer</strong> such that \(a^m \in H\).
                        By closure, \(\langle a^m \rangle \subseteq H\). 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We claim that \(H = \langle a^m \rangle\). Let \(b\) be any element in \(H\). 
                        Since \(b \in G\), we have \(b = a^k\) for some integer \(k\).
                        By the Division Algorithm, we can write \(k = mq + r\) where \(0 \leq r < m\).
                        Then:
                        \[
                        a^k = a^{mq+r} = a^{mq}a^r \implies a^r = a^{-mq}a^k.
                        \]
                        Since \(a^k \in H\) and \(a^{-mq} = (a^m)^{-q} \in H\), it follows that \(a^r \in H\). 
                        However, \(m\) is the least positive integer such that \(a^m \in H\) and \(0 \leq r < m\).
                        Thus, \(r\) must be \(0\).
                        Therefore, 
                        \[
                        b = a^k =  a^{mq} = (a^m)^q \in \langle a^m \rangle.
                        \]
                        This implies every element in \(H\) is generated by \(a^m\), and hence \(H = \langle a^m \rangle\). Therefore, 
                        every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

                    <p><strong>Part 2:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Let \(H\) be any subgroup of \(G = \langle a \rangle\), where \(|G| = n\). 
                        From Part 1, \(H = \langle a^m \rangle\), where \(m\) is the least positive integer such that \(a^m \in H\).
                        By Theorem 2, \(a^{\gcd(m, n)} \in \langle a^m \rangle = H\). Since \(\gcd(m,n) \leq m\) and \(m\) is minimal, 
                        we have \(m = \gcd(n,m)\), hence \(m\) divides \(n\). Therefore,
                        \[
                        |H| = |a^m| = \frac{n}{m},
                        \]
                        which divides \(n\). This proves that the order of any subgroup of \(G\) is a divisor of \(n\).
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        Now let \(k\) be any positive divisor of \(n\). Then \(\langle a^{n/k} \rangle\) is a subgroup of order
                        \[
                        |\langle a^{n/k} \rangle | = \frac{n}{\gcd(n, n/k)} = \frac{n}{n/k} = k.
                        \]
                        Suppose \(K\) is any subgroup of \(\langle a \rangle\) of order \(k\).
                        Then \(K\) has the form \(\langle a^s \rangle\), where \(s\) divides \(n\) and 
                        \[
                        |K| = \frac{n}{s} = k \implies s = \frac{n}{k}.
                        \]
                        Thus, \(K = \langle a^{n/k} \rangle\).

                <p>
                    Here, we introduce a family of <strong>non-Abelian</strong> groups, namely <strong>permutation groups</strong>. 
                    Remember, a <strong>permutation</strong> of a set \(A\) is a function from \(A\) to itself that is a bijective function 
                    (one-to-one and onto). For example, consider a set \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\). A permutation of \(A\) is essentially an ordered 
                    arrangement of its elements. So, the total number of permutations for \(A\) is given by the factorial \(3! = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6\).

                    A <strong>permutation group</strong> of a set \(A\) is a set of permutations of \(A\) that forms a group 
                    under function composition.

                <p>
                    For example, the permutation group of \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) is the set of all one-to-one functions from \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) to itself. 
                    We express composition of permutations in array (matrix) notation as follows: 
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    &\epsilon = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\  1 & 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} , \,  \alpha = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\  2 & 3 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \\\\
                    &\alpha^2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\  3 & 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} , \,  \beta = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\  1 & 3 & 2 \end{bmatrix}, \\\\

                    \]
                    This group is called the <strong>symmetric group</strong> of degree \(3\) and is denoted by \(S_3\). 
                    The order of this group is given by \(|S_3| = 3! = 6.\) In general, we define the symmetric group as follows: 
                </p>

                    Let \(A = \{1, 2, \cdots, n-1, n\}\). The set of all permutations of \(A\) is called the <strong>symmetric group</strong> of 
                    degree \(n\) and is denoted by \(S_n\). Elements of this group are written by:

                <p>
                    While the two-row matrix notation is explicit, it becomes cumbersome for composition and order calculation. 
                    For practical use, we employ the more compact and functional <strong>cycle notation</strong>.

Elements that are fixed (map to themselves) are usually omitted, unless they are the only element, in which case the identity element is represented by \((1)\) or \(\epsilon\).
