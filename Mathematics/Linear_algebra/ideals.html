                <h2>Ideals</h2>

                <p>
                    In our study of group theory, we learned that we cannot simply form a factor group using 
                    <em>any</em> subgroup; we require a specific kind of structure called a <strong>normal subgroup</strong>. 
                    Similarly, in ring theory, to construct a new structure by "dividing" a ring, we need a special 
                    kind of subring called an <strong>Ideal</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recall that a normal subgroup \(H\) of a group \(G\) is characterized by the property that 
                    \(gHg^{-1} = H\) for all \(g \in G\), which ensures that left and right cosets coincide. 
                    For rings, the analogous condition must account for <em>both</em> operations. The key insight is that 
                    an ideal must "absorb" multiplication from the entire ring, not just from itself.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Ideal</span>
                    <p>
                        A subring \(A\) of a ring \(R\) is called a (two-sided) <strong>ideal</strong> of \(R\) if for every 
                        \(r \in R\) and every \(a \in A\), both \(ra\) and \(ar\) are in \(A\).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The condition "\(ra \in A\) and \(ar \in A\)" is the "absorption" property. Unlike a mere subring, 
                    which only needs to be closed under multiplication <em>within itself</em>, an ideal must remain closed 
                    when multiplied by <em>any</em> element of the parent ring. This stronger condition is precisely 
                    what guarantees that the coset multiplication in the factor ring will be well-defined.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To verify that a subset is an ideal, we use a streamlined criterion analogous to the subgroup test.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Ideal Test</span>
                    <p>
                        A nonempty subset \(A\) of a ring \(R\) is an ideal of \(R\) if 
                        <ol style="padding-left: 40px;">
                            <li>\(a - b \in A\) whenever \(a, b \in A\).</li>
                            <li>\(ra\) and \(ar\) are in \(A\) whenever \(a \in A\) and \(r \in R\).</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Condition (1) ensures that \(A\) is a subgroup under addition (using the one-step subgroup test), 
                    while condition (2) is the absorption property. Together, they guarantee that \(A\) is a subring 
                    with the additional absorption requirement.

                        Consider the set \(n\mathbb{Z} = \{nk \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\}\) for a fixed integer \(n\). 
                        This is the set of all multiples of \(n\).

                        <li>
                            For any \(nk_1, nk_2 \in n\mathbb{Z}\), we have 
                            \(nk_1 - nk_2 = n(k_1 - k_2) \in n\mathbb{Z}\).

                        <li>
                            For any \(nk \in n\mathbb{Z}\) and any \(r \in \mathbb{Z}\), we have 
                            \(r(nk) = n(rk) \in n\mathbb{Z}\). Since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is commutative, 
                            \((nk)r = r(nk) \in n\mathbb{Z}\) as well.

                    <p>
                        Thus \(n\mathbb{Z}\) is an ideal of \(\mathbb{Z}\).

                    <p>
                        Such ideals, generated by a single element, are called <strong>principal ideals</strong>

                        Let \(R\) be a commutative ring with unity and let \(a \in R\). The set

                        is an ideal of \(R\) called the <strong>principal ideal generated by \(a\)</strong>.

                    Every ideal of \(\mathbb{Z}\) is principal — a fact that makes \(\mathbb{Z}\) particularly well-behaved. 
                    However, not all rings share this property. For instance, let \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) denote the ring of all 
                    polynomials with integer coefficients. (This is called a <strong>polynomial ring</strong>.) The ideal 
                    \[
                    I = \langle x, 2 \rangle = \{2f(x) + xg(x) \mid f(x), g(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\}
                    \]
                    consists of all polynomials with even constant term and cannot be generated by a single element.

                <h2>Factor Rings</h2>

                <p>
                    The concept of a <strong>factor ring</strong> (or quotient ring) is the ring-theoretic generalization of modular arithmetic. 
                    In basic arithmetic, we construct \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) by taking the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) and identifying 
                    all multiples of \(n\) with zero. In the language of rings, we say we "mod out" by the principal ideal 
                    \(\langle n \rangle = n\mathbb{Z}\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can extend this idea to any ring \(R\) and any ideal \(A\). By treating the elements of \(A\) as "zero," 
                    we collapse the ring into a simplified structure \(R/A\). The elements of this new ring are <strong>cosets</strong> — 
                    translates of the ideal that partition the original ring. This construction is one of the most powerful tools in algebra, 
                    allowing us to manufacture new fields (like Galois Fields for cryptography) by carefully choosing the ring \(R\) 
                    and the ideal \(A\).
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Factor Ring (Quotient Ring)</span>
                    <p>
                        Let \(R\) be a ring and \(A\) an ideal of \(R\). The <strong>factor ring</strong> (or <strong>quotient ring</strong>) 
                        \(R/A\) is defined as:
                        \[
                        R/A = \{r + A \mid r \in R\}
                        \]
                        where \(r + A = \{r + a \mid a \in A\}\) is the coset of \(A\) containing \(r\). The ring operations are defined by:
                        \[
                        (s + A) + (t + A) = (s + t) + A
                        \]
                        and
                        \[
                        (s + A)(t + A) = st + A.
                        \]
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    For these operations to be valid, they must be <strong>well-defined</strong>: the result must not depend on 
                    which representative we choose from each coset. This is precisely where the ideal property becomes essential.
                </p>

                        Let \(R\) be a ring and let \(A\) be a subring of \(R\). The set of cosets \(\{r + A \mid r \in R\}\) is 
                        a ring under the operations
                        \[
                        (s + A) + (t + A) = (s + t) + A
                        \]
                        and
                        \[
                        (s + A)(t + A) = st + A
                        \]
                        if and only if \(A\) is an ideal of \(R\).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                    <p>
                        First, suppose \(A\) is an ideal and let \(s + A = s' + A\) and \(t + A = t' + A\).
                        By definition, \(s = s' + a\) and \(t = t' + b\) for some \(a, b \in A\).
                        We need to show \(st + A = s't' + A\). Then 
                        \[
                        st = (s' + a)(t' + b) = s't' + at' + s'b + ab
                        \]
                        and since \(A\) absorbs \(at' + s'b + ab\),
                        \[
                        st + A = s't' + at' + s'b + ab + A = s't' + A.
                        \]
                        Thus, multiplication is well-defined when \(A\) is an ideal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We prove the second direction by contrapositive: if \(A\) is not an ideal, then the cosets 
                        do not form a ring under the given operations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suppose \(A\) is a subring of \(R\) but not an ideal. Then there exist \(a \in A\) and 
                        \(r \in R\) such that \(ar \notin A\) or \(ra \notin A\). For convenience, say \(ar \notin A\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since \(a \in A\), we have \(a + A = 0 + A\). Now consider the products:
                        \[
                        (a + A)(r + A) = ar + A \neq A \quad \text{(since } ar \notin A \text{)}
                        \]
                        \[
                        (0 + A)(r + A) = 0 \cdot r + A = A
                        \]
                        The same cosets \(a + A = 0 + A\) and \(r + A\) yield different products. 
                        Thus multiplication is not well-defined, and the set of cosets is not a ring.

                <p>
                    Not all factor rings are created equal. If we mod out \(\mathbb{Z}\) by \(\langle 6 \rangle\), we get \(\mathbb{Z}_6\), 
                    which has zero-divisors (since \(2 \cdot 3 = 6 \equiv 0\)). However, if we mod out by \(\langle 5 \rangle\), we get 
                    \(\mathbb{Z}_5\), which is a perfect <strong>field</strong>. What is the fundamental difference between the ideal 
                    \(\langle 6 \rangle\) and the ideal \(\langle 5 \rangle\)?

                <p>
                    The answer lies in the classification of ideals. Just as integers can be composite or prime, ideals can 
                    be classified based on their internal structure. This section introduces <strong>prime ideals</strong> and 
                    <strong>maximal ideals</strong>. These concepts provide a precise algebraic criterion for characterizing 
                    the structure of factor rings. Prime ideals yield integral domains, while maximal ideals yield fields. This 
                    correspondence is the engine behind constructing the finite fields used in AES encryption and Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

                        A <strong>prime ideal</strong> \(A\) of a commutative ring \(R\) is a proper ideal of \(R\) such that 
                        for all \(a, b \in R\), if \(ab \in A\), then \(a \in A\) or \(b \in A\).

                    The definition mirrors the property of prime numbers: if a prime \(p\) divides a product \(ab\), 
                    then \(p\) must divide \(a\) or \(b\). Indeed, in \(\mathbb{Z}\), an ideal \(\langle n \rangle\) is prime

                        A <strong>maximal ideal</strong> \(A\) of a commutative ring \(R\) is a proper ideal of \(R\) such that, 
                        whenever \(B\) is an ideal of \(R\) and \(A \subseteq B \subseteq R\), then \(B = A\) or

                    A maximal ideal is "as large as possible" without being the entire ring. There is no ideal 
                    strictly between a maximal ideal and the ring itself. In \(\mathbb{Z}\), the maximal ideals are 
                    exactly the ideals \(\langle p \rangle\) where \(p\) is prime — a fact that reflects the 
                    intimate connection between primality and maximality in principal ideal domains.

                        First, suppose \(R/A\) is an integral domain. Let \(ab \in A\) for some \(a, b \in R\). 
                        Then in \(R/A\):
                        \[
                        (a + A)(b + A) = ab + A = A \quad \text{(the zero element of } R/A\text{)}

                        Since \(R/A\) has no zero-divisors, either \(a + A = A\) or \(b + A = A\). 
                        This means \(a \in A\) or \(b \in A\), so \(A\) is prime.

                    <p>
                        Next, suppose \(A\) is prime and \((a + A)(b + A) = 0 + A = A\) in \(R/A\). 
                        Then \(ab + A = A\), which means \(ab \in A\). Since \(A\) is prime, \(a \in A\) or \(b \in A\). 
                        Thus, either \(a + A = A\) or \(b + A = A\) is the zero coset in \(R/A\), so \(R/A\) has no zero-divisors.

                        \(A\) (i.e., \(A \subsetneq B \subseteq R\)). Choose \(b \in B\) but \(b \notin A\). 
                        Then \(b + A \neq A\) is a nonzero element of the field \(R/A\), 
                        so it has a multiplicative inverse, say \(c + A\), such that \((b + A)(c + A) = 1 + A\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means \(1 - bc \in A \subset B\). Since \(b \in B\) and \(B\) is an ideal, \(bc \in B\). 
                        Therefore \(1 = (1 - bc) + bc \in B\). Since \(1 \in B\), we have \(B = R\). Thus, \(A\) 
                        is maximal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, suppose \(A\) is maximal and let \(b \in R\) but \(b \notin A\). We must show that 
                        \(b + A\) has a multiplicative inverse. 
                        Consider \(B = \{br + a \mid r \in R, a \in A\}\). This is an ideal of \(R\) that properly contains 
                        \(A\). Since \(A\) is maximal, we must have \(B = R\). Thus \(1 \in B\), say \(1 = bc + a'\), where 
                        \(a' \in A\). Then 
                        \[
                        1 + A = bc + a' + A = bc + A = (b + A)(c + A).
                        \]
                        This shows that \(c + A\) is the multiplicative inverse of \(b + A\). Since every nonzero element 
                        of \(R/A\) has a multiplicative inverse, \(R/A\) is a field.

                    This follows immediately: if \(A\) is maximal, then \(R/A\) is a field, which is certainly an integral domain, 
                    so \(A\) is prime. The converse is false in general; for example, \(\langle 0 \rangle\) is prime in \(\mathbb{Z}\) 
                    (since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is an integral domain) but not maximal.

                    In <a href="group_isomorphism.html"><strong>Structural Group Theory</strong></a>, we established that 
                    homomorphisms are the "structure-preserving maps" that allow us to compare different groups. We saw that the 
                    kernel of a group homomorphism is not just any subgroup, but specifically a <strong>normal subgroup</strong>.

                <p>
                    We now extend this concept to rings. Because a ring involves two operations — addition and multiplication — a 
                    <strong>ring homomorphism</strong> must preserve the structure of <em>both</em> operations simultaneously.

                        A <strong>ring homomorphism</strong> \(\phi\) from a ring \(R\) to a ring \(S\) is a mapping from \(R\) to \(S\) that

                        Let \(\Phi: R/\text{Ker } \phi \to \phi(R)\) be the mapping defined by \(\Phi(r + \text{Ker } \phi) = \phi(r)\). 
                        From the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, we already know that \(\Phi\) is a well-defined 
                        isomorphism of additive groups. That is, \(\Phi\) is one-to-one, onto, and preserves addition. 
                        It remains to show that \(\Phi\) preserves multiplication.

                        For any \(r + \text{Ker } \phi\) and \(s + \text{Ker } \phi\) in \(R/\text{Ker } \phi\):
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        \Phi((r + \text{Ker } \phi)(s + \text{Ker } \phi)) &= \Phi(rs + \text{Ker } \phi) \\\\
                                                                           &= \phi(rs)  \\\\
                                                                           &= \phi(r)\phi(s) \\\\\
                                                                           &= \Phi(r + \text{Ker } \phi)\Phi(s + \text{Ker } \phi).
                        \end{align*}
                        \]

                    <p>
                        Thus, \(\Phi\) preserves both addition and multiplication, so it is a ring isomorphism.

                    The First Isomorphism Theorem provides a powerful principle: <strong>every ring homomorphism factors through a quotient</strong>. 
                    When we map \(R \to S\) via \(\phi\), we are implicitly:
                    <ol style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li><strong>Collapsing:</strong> identifying all elements of \(\text{Ker } \phi\) with zero.</li>
                        <li><strong>Partitioning:</strong> grouping elements of \(R\) into cosets of \(\text{Ker } \phi\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Relabeling:</strong> matching each coset to its image in \(\phi(R)\).</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                    This theorem justifies our entire development: ideals are precisely the substructures that allow us to 
                    form well-defined quotients, and every such quotient arises naturally from a homomorphism.
