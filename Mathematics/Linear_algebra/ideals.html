                <p>
                    In our study of group theory, we learned that we cannot simply form a factor group using 
                    <em>any</em> subgroup; we require a specific kind of structure called a <strong>normal subgroup</strong>. 
                    Similarly, in ring theory, to construct a new structure by "dividing" a ring, we need a special 
                    kind of subring called an <strong>Ideal</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recall that a subring is a subset that is closed under subtraction and multiplication. An ideal 
                    is a subring with a much stronger property: it is "super-closed" under multiplication. If you 
                    multiply an element of the ideal by <em>any</em> element from the entire ring (even from outside the ideal), 
                    the result is "absorbed" back into the ideal. This <strong>absorption property</strong> is essentially 
                    a generalization of "multiplying by zero," and it is crucial for ensuring that multiplication is well-defined 
                    in the resulting factor ring.

                <h2>Factor Rings</h2>

                <p>
                    The concept of a <strong>factor ring</strong> (or Quotient Ring) is the generalization of modular arithmetic. 
                    In basic arithmetic, we construct \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) by taking the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) and identifying 
                    all multiples of \(n\) with zero. In the language of rings, we say we "mod out" by the principal ideal 
                    generated by \(n\), denoted \(\langle n \rangle\) or \(n\mathbb{Z}\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can extend this idea to any ring \(R\) and any ideal \(A\). By treating the elements of \(A\) as "zero," 
                    we collapse the ring into a simplified structure \(R/A\). The elements of this new ring are <strong>cosets</strong> — slices 
                    of the original ring shifted by the ideal. This construction is one of the most powerful tools in algebra, 
                    allowing us to manufacture new fields (like Galois Fields for cryptography) by carefully choosing the ring \(R\) 
                    and the ideal \(A\).

                <p>
                    Not all factor rings are created equal. If we mod out \(\mathbb{Z}\) by \(6\), we get \(\mathbb{Z}_6\), 
                    which has zero-divisors (since \(2 \cdot 3 = 6 \equiv 0\)). However, if we mod out by \(5\), we get 
                    \(\mathbb{Z}_5\), which is a perfect <strong>field</strong>. What is the fundamental difference between the ideal 
                    \(\langle 6 \rangle\) and the ideal \(\langle 5 \rangle\)?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The answer lies in the classification of ideals. Just as integers can be composite or prime, ideals can 
                    be classified based on their internal structure. This section introduces <strong>prime ideals</strong> and 
                    <strong>maximal ideals</strong>. These concepts provide the deterministic recipe for constructing specific algebraic structures: 
                    prime ideals yield integral domains, while maximal ideals yield Fields. This correspondence is the engine behind 
                    constructing the finite fields used in AES encryption and Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

                <h2>Ring Homomorphisms</h2>

               <p>
                    In <a href="group_isomorphism.html"><strong>Structural Group Theory</strong></a>, we established that 
                    homomorphisms are the "structure-preserving maps" that allow us to compare different groups. We saw that the 
                    kernel of a group homomorphism is not just any subgroup, but specifically a <strong>normal subgroup</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We now extend this concept to rings. Because a ring involves two operations — addition and multiplication — a 
                    <strong>ring homomorphism</strong> is a stricter requirement: it must preserve the structure of <em>both</em> 
                    operations simultaneously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the final piece of the puzzle justifying the definition of an ideal. Just as the kernel of a group 
                    homomorphism was a normal subgroup, the kernel of a ring homomorphism is exactly an <strong>ideal</strong>. 
                    The <strong>first isomorphism theorem for rings</strong> mirrors the one for groups, confirming that "ideals" 
                    are indeed the correct structural equivalent to "normal subgroups" in the richer landscape of ring theory.

                        A <strong>ring homomorphism</strong> \(\phi\) from a ring \(R\) to a ring \(S\) is a mapping from \(R\) to \(S\) that
