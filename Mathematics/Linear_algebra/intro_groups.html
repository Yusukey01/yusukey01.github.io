                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    At this point, we are already familiar with the rules of linear algebra, and we have encountered many mathematical objects and 
                    operations in our school life. What we have done is essentially studying operations constrained by a particular environment, or 
                    <strong>structure</strong>. Now, we would like to discuss the "structure" of our mathematical world more formally. From now on, 
                    the term "algebra" expands beyond algebraic computation to mean the study of these underlying structures. 
                    In <strong>abstract algebra</strong>, we learn the fundamental laws that govern operations across mathematics. 
                    Our goal is to categorize these mathematical structures (Groups, Rings, and Fields), giving us a clear, unified view of the 
                    mathematical world. This rigorous approach is not just theoretical, which will contribute directly to advancements in 
                    computer science and engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We start with a special kind of set, which is called a <strong>group</strong>.

                        <p>
                        A set \(G\) is said to be a <strong>group</strong> under a <strong>binary operation</strong> if the following three properties 
                        are satisfied: 
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Associativity</strong></li>
                            \[
                            \forall a, b, c \in G, \, (ab)c = a(bc).
                            \]
                            <li><strong>Identity</strong></li>
                            \[
                            \forall a \in G, \exists \, e \in G \text{ s.t. } ae = ea = a.
                            \]
                            <li> <strong>Inverses</strong></li>
                            \[
                            \forall a \in G, \exists \, b \in G \text{ s.t. } ab = ba = e.
                            \]
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        Note that the <strong>binary operation</strong> assings to each ordered pair \(a, b\) of elements of \(G\) an element in \(G\). We deonte it by 
                        \(ab \in G\). This condition is called <strong>closure</strong>.

                <p>           
                    For example, consider a square matrix: 
                    \[
                    A = 
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                                   a & b \\
                                   c & d \\
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \]
                    assuming \(\det(A) = ad -bc \neq 0\) where a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}. 
                    Then we know that we have the identity matrix: 
                     \[
                    I = 
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                                   1 & 0 \\
                                   0 & 1 \\
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \]
                    such that 
                    \[
                    IA = AI = A
                    \]
                    and the inverse of \(A\): 
                     \[
                    A^{-1} = 
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                                   \frac{d}{\det (A)} & \frac{-b}{\det (A)} \\
                                   \frac{-c}{\det (A)} & \frac{a}{\det (A)} \\
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \]
                    such that 
                    \[
                    AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I 
                    \]
                    We would like to say that this set of all \(2 \times 2\) invertible matrices forms the group 
                    under matrix multiplication:
                    \[
                    GL(2, \mathbb{R}) = 
                                \left\{  
                                \begin{bmatrix}
                                   a & b \\
                                   c & d \\
                                \end{bmatrix}  
                                \mid a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}, \, ad-bc \neq 0
                                \right\}.
                    \]
                    This group, the <strong>general linear group</strong> of degree 2 over the real numbers, is a 
                    fundamental object in abstract algebra.

                <p>
                    The genral linear group is a typical examle of a <strong>non-Abelian</strong> group.

                        If a group \(G\) satisfies the commutative property for every pair of its elements \(a\) and \(b\), 
                        the group \(G\) is called an <strong>Abelian</strong> group.
                        \[

                <p>
                    As we know, in matrix multiplication, for matrices \(A\) and \(B\), 
                    \[
                    AB \neq BA.
                    \]
                    Thus, \(GL(2, \mathbb{R})\) is a non-Abelian group.

                <p>
                    For example, a simple Abelian group can be the set of nonzero real numbers under ordinary multiplication, denoted by \(\mathbb{R}^*\).
                    Let \(x \in \mathbb{R}^*\), then the identity is \(1\), the inverse is \(\frac{1}{x}\). Moreover, for every \(x, y \in  \mathbb{R}^*\), 
                    \(xy = yx \in \mathbb{R}^*\).

                <h2>The Group of Units Modulo \(n\)</h2>

                <p>
                    In Computer Science, we frequently use <strong>modular arithmetic</strong>, which is fundamental to 
                    cryptography (e.g., RSA), hashing algorithms, and how computers handle integer representations. 
                    Here we introduce the <strong>Group of Units Modulo \(n\)</strong>, denoted by \(U(n)\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, let's briefly review the definition of the modulo operation, which is based on the Division Algorithm:

                        Given integers \(a\) (dividend) and \(n\) (divisor), we write \(a \bmod n = r\) if:
                        \[
                        a = qn + r
                        \]
                        where \(q\) is the quotient and \(r\) is the remainder, 
                        and the remainder must satisfy the condition \(0 \leq r < n\). 
                        <br><br>
                        For example,

                <p>
                    An important property in modular arithmetic is that 
                    an integer \(a\) has a multiplicative inverse modulo \(n\) 
                    if and only if 
                    \(a\) and \(n\) are relatively prime
                    (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1, \(\gcd(a, n) = 1\)). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For any positive integer \(n\), we define \(U(n)\) to be the set of all positive integers less than \(n\) 
                    that are relatively prime to \(n\). This set \(U(n)\) forms a group under the operation of multiplication modulo \(n\). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, when \(n = 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3\), we eliminate multiples of 2 and 3 from \(\{1, 2, \cdots, 10, 11\}\), 
                    we obtain \(U(12) = \{1, 5, 7, 11\}\). Moreover, <strong>Cayley Table for \(U(12) = \{1, 5, 7, 11\}\)</strong> is as follows:

                <h2>Multiplicative Group vs Additive Group</h2>

                <p>
                    So far we have seen <strong>multiplicative groups</strong> whose binary operation is some sort of 
                    multiplication (like matrix multiplication or modular multiplication), but sometimes binary operation can be addition. 
                    A simple <strong>additive group</strong> is the set of integers:
                    \[
                    \mathbb{Z} = \{\cdots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \cdots\}
                    \]
                    This set forms a group under standard addition, which is a valid binary operation since the sum of two integers is an integer.
                    For any \(a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}\): 
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                     &(a + b) + c = a + (b + c), \\\\
                     &a + 0 = 0 + a = a, \\\\
                     &a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0. \\\\
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    In addition, this group is Abelian since standard addition is commutative: \(a + b = b + a\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In abstract algebra, the choice of operation impacts notation, which can be initially confusing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In "additive" groups, the notation \(a^m\) is written by \(ma\). For instance, \(a^3\) means repeated addition:
                     \[
                    a^3 \rightarrow \quad a + a + a = 3a.
                    \]
                    Note that the multiplier \(3\) here is NOT an element being combined with \(a\) under the group operation.
                    Similarly, \(-3a\) represents the sum of three inverses \((-a)+(-a)+(-a)\). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In "multiplicative" groups, we use exponent rules familiar from algebra, such as 
                    \(a^m a^n = a^{m+n}\) and \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\). 
                    However, the definition of the group structure requires careful expansion, especially in non-Abelian groups:
                    \[
                    (ab)^2 = abab \quad \text{NOT} \quad a^2b^2 \text{ (unless the group is Abelian)}.
                    \]
                    Note that the expression \( (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 \) is valid if and only if the group is Abelian. 
                    This is because commutativity (\(ab = ba\)) allows for the rearrangement:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    (ab)^2 &= a \cdot b \cdot a \cdot b \\\\
                           &= a \cdot a \cdot b \cdot b \\\\
                           &= a^2b^2. 
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, for negative exponents: 
                    \[
                    (ab)^{-2} = ((ab)^{-1})^2 = (b^{-1}a^{-1})(b^{-1}a^{-1}).
                    \]
                     Note that for \(a^n \in G\), if \(n\) is negative, \(a^n = (a^{-1})^{|n|}\). 
                     Also, the exponent \(n\) is always an integer (unlike exponents used in the field of real numbers). 
                     The zero exponent represents the identity element: \(\mathbf{a^0 = e}\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moreover, we define the <strong>order of an "element"</strong> \(a \in G\) denoted by \(|a|\) as the smallest positive integer \(n\) 
                    such that \(a^n =e\). (In additive notation, \(na = 0\).) If there is no such integer, the element \(a\) has 
                    <strong>infinte order</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, in \(U(12) = \{1, 5, 7, 11\}\), 
                     \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        \text{ The order of 1 is 1 since } 1^1 &= 1 = (0 \cdot 12) + 1, \\\\
                        \text{ The order of 5 is 2 since } 5^2 &= 25 =  (2 \cdot 12) + 1,\\\\
                        \text{ The order of 7 is 2 since }  7^2 &= 49 =   (4 \cdot 12) + 1,\\\\
                        \text{ The order of 11 is 2 since } 11^2 &= 121 =  (10 \cdot 12) + 1. \\\\
                        \end{align*}

                    If a subset \(H\) of a group \(G\) is itself a group under the same operation of \(G\), \(H\) is said to be 
                    a <strong>subgroup</strong> of \(G\) denoted as \(H \leq G\). 
                    (Like the set theory, \(H < G\) represents a "proper" subgroup.)
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    For example, consider the group of integers under addition, \(\mathbb{Z}\). Let \(H\) be the set of all even 
                    integers: 
                    \[
                    H = \{\dots, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, \dots\},
                    \]
                    This subset \(H\) forms a group under the same standard addition because the sum of two even integers is 
                    always an even integer, which holds commutativity, the identity \(0 \in H\), and the inverse of any even 
                    integer is also an even integer. Thus, \(H \leq \mathbb{Z}\).

                <p>
                    Checking all group axioms every time can be tedious. A way to show that a subset \(H\) of a group \(G\) is a subgroup of \(G\)
                    is <strong>One-Step Subgroup Test</strong>:

                        A nonempty subset \(H\) of a group \(G\) is a subgroup if for all \(a, b \in H\), 
                        the element \(a b^{-1} \in H\). (In additive notation, check \(a - b) \in H\).

                    <p>
                        We must verify that \(H\) possesses the identity element, inverses for every element, and closure. 
                        First, aqssociativity is inherited automatically from \(G\).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Since \(H\) is nonempty, there exists at least one element \(x \in H\). 
                        Applying the hypothesis with \(a = x\) and \(b = x\), we get:
                        \[
                        a b^{-1} = x x^{-1} = e.
                        \]
                        Since the result must be in \(H\), the identity element \(\mathbf{e \in H}\).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now we know \(e \in H\), let \(x\) be any element in \(H\).
                        Apply the hypothesis with \(a = e\) and \(b = x\):
                        \[
                        a b^{-1} = e x^{-1} = x^{-1}.
                        \]
                        Since the result must be in \(H\), for every \(x \in H\), 
                        its inverse \(\mathbf{x^{-1} \in H}\).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, we must show that \(H\) is closed. 
                        Let \(x\) and \(y\) be any two elements in \(H\). We must show that \(xy \in H\).
                        We have already shown that if \(y \in H\), then \(y^{-1} \in H\).
                        Now, apply the hypothesis with \(a = x\) and \(b = y^{-1}\):
                        \[
                        a b^{-1} = x (y^{-1})^{-1} = xy 
                        \]
                        Since the result must be in \(H\), \(\mathbf{xy \in H}\).

                    <p>
                        Therefore, \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).

                    Let \(G\) be a group and let \(a\) be any element of \(G\). 
                    The set of all integer powers of \(a\) is called the cyclic subgroup of \(G\) generated by \(a\), denoted by \(\langle a \rangle\):

                        \]
                        Since \(m\) and \(n\) are integers, their difference \(m-n\) is also an integer. 
                        Therefore, \(a^{m-n}\) is another power of \(a\), so it must be in \(\langle a \rangle\).

                    Let's revisite the group \(U(12) = \{1, 5, 7, 11\}\) under multiplication modulo 12.
                    We can generate subgroups by picking elements and computing their powers modulo 12.

                    The <strong>center</strong> of a group \(G\) is the subset of elements in \(G\) that commute with every element 
                    of \(G\):
                    \[

                    The identity element \(e \in G\) commutes with every element \(x \in G\):
                    \[
                    ex = xe = x.
                    \]
                    So, \(e \in Z(G)\) and thus \(Z(G)\) is nonempty. Now, Let \(a, b \in Z(G)\), and \(x \in G\). 
                    Since \(a, b \in Z(G)\), 
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    ax &= xa, \\\\
                    bx &= xb. \\\\
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    We must show that if \(a, b \in Z(G)\), then \(c = ab^{-1} \in Z(G)\). So we must show that \(c\) 
                    commutes with every element \(x \in G\):
                    \[
                    cx = xc.
                    \]
                    From the left hand side of this equation: 
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    cx &= (ab^{-1})x \\\\
                       &= a(b^{-1}x) \\\\
                       &= a(xb^{-1}) && \text{(Since } b \in Z(G) \text{ implies } xb^{-1} = b^{-1}x \text{)} \\\\
                       &= (ax)b^{-1} \\\\
                       &= (xa)b^{-1} \\\\
                       &= x(ab^{-1}) \\\\
                       &= xc.
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    Thus, \(ab^{-1} \in Z(G)\), which satisfies the one-step subgroup test.
                    Therefore, \(Z(G) \leq G\).

                <p>
                    Note that the Center \(Z(G)\) is always an <strong>Abelian subgroup</strong>:
                    <br>
                    The definition of \(Z(G)\) requires an element \(a\) to commute with all elements in \(G\). 
                    If we take any two elements, \(a\) and \(b\), from \(Z(G)\), \(a\) must commute with \(b\). 
                    Thus, \(ab = ba\), which satisfies the definition of an Abelian group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, a group \(G\) is Abelian if and only if its Center is the entire group.
                <div class="theorem">
                    \[
                    G \text{ is Abelian } \iff Z(G) = G.
                    \] 
                </div>
                    The reasoning also comes from their definition. If \(G\) is Abelian \(\Rightarrow \), every element 
                    commutes with every other element, so every element must be in the Center \(Z(G) = G\). Conversely, 
                    if \(Z(G) = G\) \(\Leftarrow \), the definition of the Center dictates that every element must commute 
                    with every other element, making \(G\) Abelian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, \(U(12) = \{1, 5, 7, 11\} = Z(U(12))\), whereas \(GL(2, \mathbb{R}) \neq Z(GL(2, \mathbb{R}))\) since 
                    \[
                    Z(GL(2, \mathbb{R})) = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} c & 0 \\

                    The <strong>centralizer</strong> is a generalization f the Center \(Z(G)\) that allows us to precisely identify and

                        The identity element \(e\) is in \(C(a)\) since \(ea = ae = a\), so \(C(a)\) is nonempty.

                        Let \(x, y \in C(a)\). We must show \(xy^{-1} \in C(a)\), meaning \((xy^{-1})a = a(xy^{-1})\).

                    <p>
                        We know \(xa = ax\) and \(ya = ay\). From the latter, we derive that \(y^{-1}\) also commutes with \(a\):
                        From \(ya = ay\), multiplying by \(y^{-1}\) on both sides:
                        \[
                        y^{-1}(ya)y^{-1} = y^{-1}(ay)y^{-1} \implies ay^{-1} = y^{-1}a.

                        Now we verify that \(xy^{-1}\) commutes with \(a\):
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        (xy^{-1})a &= x(y^{-1}a)  \\\\
                                &= x(ay^{-1}) && \text{(Since } y \in C(a) \text{)} \\\\
                                &= (xa)y^{-1}  \\\\
                                &= (ax)y^{-1} && \text{(Since } x \in C(a) \text{)} \\\\

                        Thus, \(xy^{-1}\) commutes with \(a\), and by the one-step subgroup test, \(C(a) \leq G\).

                    \] 
                </div>
                   
                <p>
                    This inclusion follows directly from the definitions: 
                    <br>
                    an element that commutes with every element of \(G\) certainly commutes with \(a\) in particular. 
                    On the other hand, , if an element \(g\) lies in every \(C(a)\), then \(g\) commutes with 
                    all elements of \(G\), hence \(g \in Z(G)\). 
                    Therefore, the center is precisely the intersection of all centralizers:
                    \[
                    Z(G) = \bigcap_{a \in G} C(a).
                    \]
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Another important fact is as follows:
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    \[
                    G \text{ is Abelian } \iff \forall a \in G, \, C(a) = G.
                    \]
                </div>

                <p>
                    This is also straightforward: if \(G\) is Abelian, every element commutes with every other, 
                    so \(C(a) = G\) for all \(a\). Conversely, if \(C(a) = G\) for all \(a \in G\), then every 
                    element of \(G\) commutes with \(a\), and since \(a\) is arbitrary, every pair of elements commutes, 
                    so \(G\) is Abelian.
                </p> 
                <br>
                <p>
                    Remember, the General Linear Group \(G = GL(2, \mathbb{R})\) is non-Abelian. We have shown that its 
                    center \(Z(G)\) consists only of scalar matrices. To verify the intersection formula, consider a 
                    non-scalar matrix \(A \in G\), for instance, the shear matrix:
                    \[
                    A = \begin{pmatrix} 
                        1 & 1 \\ 
                        0 & 1 
                        \end{pmatrix}.
                    \]
                    Its centralizer \(C(A)\) is the set of all matrices \(M \in G\) that commute with \(A\) (\(MA = AM\)). 
                    Solving for 
                    \[
                    M = \begin{pmatrix} 
                            x & y \\ 
                            z & w 
                        \end{pmatrix}
                    \]
                    shows that \(C(A)\) requires \(z=0\) and \(w=x\):
                    \[
                    C(A) = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 
                                    x & y \\ 
                                    0 & x 
                                    \end{pmatrix} 
                            \mid x, y \in \mathbb{R}, x \neq 0 \right\}.
                    \]
                    Notice that \(C(A)\) is a subgroup of \(G\), which fits the hierarchy \(Z(G) \subsetneq C(A) \subsetneq G\). 
                    If we calculate the centralizer for a different non-scalar matrix, say 
                    \[
                    B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix},
                    \]
                    we get a different subgroup \(C(B)\). The intersection of all such centralizers removes 
                    elements that fail to commute with some matrix, leaving only the center \(Z(G)\).
                </p>
               

                <p>
                    In contrast, for the Abelian group \(U(12)\), every element commutes with every other element. 
                    This means the centralizer of every element is the entire group:
                    \[
                    C(1) = C(5) = C(7) = C(11) = U(12).
                    \]
                    Therefore, the intersection of all centralizers is simply the intersection of the set \(U(12)\) with itself, 
                    confirming that \(Z(U(12)) = U(12)\).
