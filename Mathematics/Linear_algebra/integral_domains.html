                <h2>The Struggle for Factorization</h2>
                <p>
                    In our previous study of polynomial rings, we relied on a comforting assumption: that every object can be uniquely decomposed 
                    into its "prime" components. But as we move deeper into abstract algebra, we discover that uniqueness is not a universal law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This chapter marks the finale of our journey through Ring Theory. Here, we categorize rings based on how they handle <strong>divisibility</strong>. 
                    We will see that the integers and polynomials are just special cases of a much broader hierarchy of <strong>Integral Domains</strong>.

                <h2>Irreducibles vs. Primes: A Subtle Distinction</h2>
                <p>
                    In elementary arithmetic, "prime" and "irreducible" are synonyms. However, in general rings, they represent two different concepts. 
                    Understanding this gap is the first step toward seeing why unique factorization can fail.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Associates, Irreducibles, Primes</span>
                    Elements \(a\) and \(b\) of an integral domain \(D\) are called <strong>associates</strong> if \(a = ub\)
                    where \(u\) is a unit of \(D\).
                    <br><br>
                    A nonzero element \(a\) of an integral domain \(D\) is called <strong>irreducible</strong> if \(a\) is not a 
                    unit and, whenever \(b, c \in D\) with \(a = bc\), then \(b\) or \(c\) is a unit of \(D\).
                    <br><br>
                    A nonzero element \(a\) of an integral domain \(D\) is called a <strong>prime</strong> if \(a\) is not a unit 
                    and \(a \mid bc\) implies \(a \mid b\) or \(a \mid c\).
                </div>

                <p>
                    Let's being with the following theorem.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Prime implies Irreducible</span>
                    In an integral domain, every prime is an irreducible.
                </div>

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                    Suppse that \(a\) is a prime in an integral domain and \(a = bc\). We must show that \(b\) or \(c\) is 
                    a unit. By the definition, \(a \mid b\) or \(a \mid c\).
                    <br>
                    Here, let \(at = b\). Then
                    \[
                    1b = b = at = (bc)t = b(ct).
                    \]
                    By cancellation,
                    \[
                    1 = ct.
                    \]
                    Therefore, \(c\) is a unit. 
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Consider \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\), which contains all elements that form \(a + b\sqrt{-5}\). 
                    Here, there are two ways to represent \(6\).
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    6 &=  = (2 + 0 \cdot \sqrt{-5})(3 - 0 \cdot \sqrt{-5}) = 2 \times 3 \\\\
                    6 &= (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5})
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    However, neither \((1 + \sqrt{-5})\) nor \((1 - \sqrt{-5})\) are divisible by \(2\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus, while every prime element is irreducible in any integral domain, the converse is not always true 
                    A ring where every irreducible is also prime is a very special place - one that allows for unique factorization.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: PID implies Irreducible equals Prime</span>
                    In a principal ideal domain (PID), an element is an irreducible if and only if it is a prime.
                </div>

                <p>
                    Remember, \(\mathbb{Z}\) and \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\) are a PID, but \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) is not. Consider the ideal 
                    \(I = \langle 3, x \rangle\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\). This ideal contains, for example, \(3, x, x^2 + 6,\) and \(5x+9\). 
                    If \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) is a PID, there must exist a single polynomial \(h(x)\) that acts as the greatest common divisor 
                    for both \(3\) and \(x\). To divies the constant \(3\), \(h(x)\) must be either \(1\) or \(3\). If \(h(x) = 3\), it 
                    cannot divide \(x\) because \(\frac{1}{3}\) is not an integer. If \(h(x) = 1\), \(I\) would have to contain every 
                    polynomial in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\), including \(1\). However, any element in \(\langle 3, x \rangle\) mut have a constant
                    term divisible by 3. Thus, no such \(h(x)\) exists.

                <h2>The Hierarchy of Domains</h2>
                <p>
                    We classify integral domains into a nesting hierarchy, each adding more structural requirements.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Euclidean Domains (ED)</h3>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Euclidean Domain (ED)</span>
                    An integral domain \(D\) is called a <strong>Euclidean Domain (ED)</strong> if there is a function 
                    \(d\) (called the <strong>measure</strong>) from the nonzero elements of \(D\) to the nonnegative 
                    integers such that
                    <ol style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>\(d(a) \leq d(ab)\) for all nonzero elements \(a, b \in D\); and</li> 
                        <li>if \(a, b \in D\) and \(b \neq 0\), then there exist elements \(q, r \in D\) such that 
                            \(a = bq + r\), where \(r = 0\) or \(d(r) < d(b)\).</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Rings where we can perform the <strong>Division Algorithm</strong>. These are the most "computational" rings, as they allow 
                    the <strong>Euclidean Algorithm</strong> to function. For example, 
                    \(\mathbb{Z}\), \(F[x]\) such as \(\mathbb{Q}[x], \mathbb{R}[x], \mathbb{C}[x]\), and Gaussian Integers \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\).
                </p>

                <h3>2. Principal Ideal Domains (PID)</h3>
                <p>
                    Rings where every ideal is generated by a single element. In a PID, the distinction between primes and irreducibles disappears. 
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: ED implies PID</span>
                    Every Euclidean  domain (ED) is a principal ideal domain (PID).
                </div>

                <p>
                    Note that \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) is famously NOT a PID, so it is not ED neither. 
                </p>

                <h3>3. Unique Factorization Domains (UFD)</h3>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Unique Factorization Domain (UFD)</span>
                    An integral domain \(D\) is a <strong>unique factorization domain</strong> if 
                    <ol style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>every nonzero element of \(D\) that is not a unit can be written as a product of irreducibles of \(D\); and</li>
                        <li>the factorization into irreducibles is unique up to associates and the order in which the factors appear.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Both \(\mathbb{Z}\) and \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\) are UFDs. Actually, in general, every PID is a UFD.
                </p>
              
                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: PID implies UFD</span>
                    Every principal ideal domain (PID) is a unique factorization domain (UFD).
                </div>
                 
                <p>
                    Thanks to Gauss's Lemma, \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) also manages to be a UFD, preserving the uniqueness we 
                    need for polynomials.

                    Let \(F\) be a field. Then \(F[x]\) is a unique factorization domain.

                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li><strong>Efficient Inversion:</strong> If a ring is an <strong>ED</strong>, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to 
                        find multiplicative inverses (the core of AES and RSA).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cryptographic Security:</strong> If unique factorization fails, many assumptions in public-key cryptography 
                        collapse. We rely on the UFD property to ensure that a public key maps back to a unique private key.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lattice-based PQC:</strong> Many post-quantum schemes use rings that are NOT PIDs (like polynomial 
                        quotient rings). Understanding the ideal structure becomes the primary way to evaluate their security.</li>
                </ul>

                    In the next section, we move to <strong>Field Theory</strong>, exploring how to expand these structures to solve equations 
                    that seem impossible in our current universe.
