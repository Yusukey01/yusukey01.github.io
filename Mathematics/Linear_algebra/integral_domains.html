                <h2>The Struggle for Factorization</h2>
                <p>
                    In our previous study of polynomial rings, we relied on a comforting assumption: that every object can be uniquely decomposed 
                    into its "prime" components. But as we move deeper into abstract algebra, we discover that uniqueness is not a universal law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This chapter marks the finale of our journey through Ring Theory. Here, we categorize rings based on how they handle divisibility. 
                    We will see that the integers and polynomials are just special cases of a much broader hierarchy of <strong>Integral Domains</strong>.

                <h2>Irreducibles vs. Primes: A Subtle Distinction</h2>
                <p>
                    In elementary arithmetic, "prime" and "irreducible" are synonyms. However, in general rings, they represent two different concepts. 
                    Understanding this gap is the first step toward seeing why unique factorization can fail.
                </p>

                    Elements \(a\) and \(b\) of an integral domain \(D\) are called <strong>associates</strong> if \(a = ub\)

                    A nonzero element \(a\) of an integral domain \(D\) is called a <strong>prime</strong> if \(a\) is not a unit

                    A ring where every irreducible is also prime is a very special place - one that allows for unique factorization.

                <h2>The Hierarchy of Domains</h2>
                <p>
                    We classify integral domains into a nesting hierarchy, each adding more structural requirements.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Euclidean Domains (ED)</h3>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Euclidean Domain (ED)</span>
                    An integral domain \(D\) is called a <strong>Euclidean Domain (ED)</strong> if there is a function 
                    \(d\) (called the <strong>measure</strong>) from the nonzero elements of \(D\) to the nonnegative 
                    integers such that
                    <ol style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>\(d(a) \leq d(ab)\) for all nonzero elements \(a, b \in D\); and</li> 
                        <li>if \(a, b \in D\) and \(b \neq 0\), then there exist elements \(q, r \in D\) such that 
                            \(a = bq + r\), where \(r = 0\) or \(d(r) < d(b)\).</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Rings where we can perform the <strong>Division Algorithm</strong>. These are the most "computational" rings, as they allow 
                    the <strong>Euclidean Algorithm</strong> to function. 
                    Examples: \(\mathbb{Z}\), \(F[x]\), and Gaussian Integers \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\).
                </p>

                <h3>2. Principal Ideal Domains (PID)</h3>
                <p>
                    Rings where every ideal is generated by a single element. In a PID, the distinction between primes and irreducibles disappears. 
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: ED implies PID</span>
                    Every Euclidean  domain (ED) is a principal ideal domain (PID).
                </div>

                <p>
                    Note that \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) is famously NOT a PID, which is a common point of "struggle" in algebra.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Unique Factorization Domains (UFD)</h3>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Unique Factorization Domain (UFD)</span>
                    An integral domain \(D\) is a <strong>unique factorization domain</strong> if 
                    <ol style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>every nonzero element of \(D\) that is not a unit can be written as a product of irreducibles of \(D\); and</li>
                        <li>the factorization into irreducibles is unique up to associates and the order in which the factors appear.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="theorem">

                    Every principal ideal domain (PID) is a unique factorization domain (UFD).
                </div>
                <p>
                    Thanks to Gauss's Lemma, \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) also manages to be a UFD, preserving the uniqueness we 
                    need for polynomials.

                    Let \(F\) be a field. Then \(F[x]\) is a unique factorization domain.

                    If \(D\) is a unique factorization domain, then \(D[x]\) is also a a unique factorization domain.

                <h2>The Failure of Uniqueness</h2>
                <p>
                    To understand why we value these hierarchies, we must look at where they fall apart. Consider the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\). 
                    In this domain, the number 6 has two distinct factorizations:
                    \[ 6 = 2 \cdot 3 = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5}) \]
                    Here, 2, 3, and \(1 \pm \sqrt{-5}\) are all irreducible, but none of them are prime. This breakdown means that in this ring, 
                    "DNA" is not unique.

                    <li><strong>Cryptographic Security:</strong> If unique factorization fails, many assumptions in public-key cryptography 
                        collapse. We rely on the UFD property to ensure that a public key maps back to a unique private key.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lattice-based PQC:</strong> Many post-quantum schemes use rings that are NOT PIDs (like polynomial 
                        quotient rings). Understanding the ideal structure becomes the primary way to evaluate their security.</li>

                    With this hierarchy, we conclude our formal study of <strong>Ring Theory</strong>. We have seen how structure governs 
                    divisibility, and how "niceness" in a ring is a specific mathematical property.

                    In the next section, we move to <strong>Field Theory</strong>, exploring how to expand these structures to solve equations 
                    that seem impossible in our current universe.
