                <h2>Graph Laplacian Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>
                    The <strong>graph Laplacian</strong> is a matrix representation that captures the structure of a graph 
                    and plays a central role in spectral graph theory. Building on your knowledge of 
                    <a href="../Discrete/intro_graph.html">graph theory</a> and <a href="eigenvectors.html">eigenvalues</a>, 
                    we'll explore how the Laplacian encodes connectivity patterns and enables powerful analytical techniques.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    If \(G\) is a graph with vertex set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n-1, n\}\). Let \(D(G)\) be the \(n \times n\) diagonal 
                    matrix of vertex degrees of \(G\). The <strong>Laplacian matrix</strong> is defined as 
                    \[
                    L(G) = D(G) - A(G)
                    \]
                    where \(A(G)\) is the adjacency matrix of \(G\).

                <p>
                    Moreover, the <strong>spectral decomposition</strong> of the Laplacian matrix \(\boldsymbol{L}\) reveals deeper structure and provides a 
                    spectral interpretation of smoothness on graphs. 
                    Since \(\boldsymbol{L}\) is symmetric and positive semi-definite, it admits an orthonormal eigendecomposition:
                    \[
                    \boldsymbol{L} = \boldsymbol{V}\,\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\,\boldsymbol{V}^\top, 
                    \quad
                    \boldsymbol{\Lambda} = \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_N),
                    \]
                    with ordered eigenvalues
                    \[
                    0 = \lambda_1 \le \lambda_2 \le \cdots \le \lambda_N,
                    \]
                    and orthonormal eigenvectors \(\boldsymbol{v}_1, \dots, \boldsymbol{v}_N\) forming a complete basis for functions defined on the graph.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Several important spectral properties follow:
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue</strong> equals the number of connected components in the graph.  
                        For a connected graph, \(\lambda_1 = 0\) is simple, and its eigenvector is proportional to the constant vector \(\boldsymbol{1}\).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>second smallest eigenvalue</strong>, \(\lambda_2\), known as the <strong>algebraic connectivity</strong> (or <strong>Fiedler value</strong>), 
                        quantifies the graph's overall connectivity: larger \(\lambda_2\) implies stronger connectivity and fewer natural partitions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For any unit-norm eigenvector \(\boldsymbol{v}_k\),
                        \[
                        \boldsymbol{v}_k^\top \boldsymbol{L}\, \boldsymbol{v}_k = \lambda_k,
                        \]
                        meaning that eigenvectors with larger eigenvalues correspond to functions of higher “energy” (less smoothness) on the graph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If an arbitrary function \(\boldsymbol{f}\) is expanded in this eigenbasis as
                        \[
                        \boldsymbol{f} = \sum_{k=1}^N \alpha_k \boldsymbol{v}_k,
                        \]
                        its Dirichlet energy decomposes as
                        \[
                        \boldsymbol{f}^\top \boldsymbol{L}\, \boldsymbol{f} = \sum_{k=1}^N \alpha_k^2 \lambda_k.
                        \]
                        Hence, components along higher-\(\lambda\) eigenvectors contribute more to the overall roughness of \(\boldsymbol{f}\).
                    </li>

            <h3>Spectral Properties and the Fiedler Vector</h3>
            <p>
                The eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian provide deep insights into graph structure. For the unnormalized Laplacian \(\mathbf{L}\), 
                the eigenvalues satisfy \(0 = \lambda_0 \leq \lambda_1 \leq \cdots \leq \lambda_{n-1}\).
            </p>

            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">The Fiedler Vector and Algebraic Connectivity</span>
                The second smallest eigenvalue \(\lambda_1\) is called the <strong>algebraic connectivity</strong> or <strong>Fiedler value</strong>. 
                Its corresponding eigenvector \(v_1\) (the <strong>Fiedler vector</strong>) has remarkable properties:
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>\(\lambda_1 > 0\) if and only if the graph is connected</li>
                    <li>Larger \(\lambda_1\) indicates stronger connectivity</li>
                    <li>The Fiedler vector provides a natural 1D embedding that tends to separate loosely connected parts</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>The Spectral Gap and Cheeger's Inequality</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>spectral gap</strong> \(\lambda_1\) relates to how well-connected the graph is. This is formalized by Cheeger's inequality, 
                which bounds the relationship between the spectral gap and the graph's expansion properties:
            </p>

            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Cheeger's Inequality</span>
                For a connected graph, let \(h(G)\) be the <strong>Cheeger constant</strong> (isoperimetric number):
                \[
                h(G) = \min_{S \subset V, 0 < |S| \leq n/2} \frac{|\partial S|}{\min(|S|, |V \setminus S|)}
                \]
                where \(|\partial S|\) is the number of edges between \(S\) and its complement. Then:
                \[
                \frac{h(G)^2}{2d_{max}} \leq \lambda_1 \leq 2h(G)
                \]
                This shows that graphs with large spectral gaps have good expansion properties—there are no "bottlenecks" separating the graph into weakly connected parts.
            </p>

            <h3>Graph Signal Processing Perspective</h3>
            <p>
                The eigenvectors of the Laplacian form a <strong>Fourier basis</strong> for signals on the graph. For a signal \(f: V \to \mathbb{R}\) 
                defined on vertices:
            </p>

            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Graph Fourier Transform</span>
                If \(\mathbf{U} = [u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_{n-1}]\) contains the eigenvectors of \(\mathbf{L}\), the Graph Fourier Transform is:
                \[
                \hat{f} = \mathbf{U}^T f
                \]
                and the inverse transform:
                \[
                f = \mathbf{U} \hat{f}
                \]
                The eigenvalues \(\lambda_i\) represent "frequencies": 
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>Small \(\lambda_i\) ↔ low frequency (smooth over graph)</li>
                    <li>Large \(\lambda_i\) ↔ high frequency (oscillatory over graph)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                This perspective is crucial for Graph Neural Networks, where spectral methods like ChebNet use polynomial approximations 
                of spectral filters:
                \[
                g_\theta(L) = \sum_{k=0}^K \theta_k T_k(\tilde{L})
                \]
                where \(T_k\) are Chebyshev polynomials and \(\tilde{L} = \frac{2}{\lambda_{max}}L - I\) is the scaled Laplacian.
            </p>

            <h3>Connection to Random Walks and Diffusion</h3>
            <p>
                The normalized Laplacian connects to random walks and diffusion processes on graphs:
            </p>

            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Heat Diffusion on Graphs</span>
                The heat equation on a graph is:
                \[
                \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -\mathbf{L} u
                \]
                with solution:
                \[
                u(t) = e^{-t\mathbf{L}} u(0) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} e^{-t\lambda_i} \langle u(0), v_i \rangle v_i
                \]
                This shows how initial heat distribution \(u(0)\) diffuses over the graph, with convergence rate determined by \(\lambda_1\).
            </div>

            <h3>Computational Considerations for Large Graphs</h3>
            <p>
                For graphs with millions of nodes (common in 2025 applications), exact eigendecomposition is infeasible. 
                Modern approaches include:
            </p>

            <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Lanczos Algorithm:</strong> Iteratively finds top-k eigenvectors in \(O(kn)\) per iteration</li>
                <li><strong>Power Iteration:</strong> Simple method for dominant eigenvector, basis for PageRank</li>
                <li><strong>Chebyshev Polynomial Approximation:</strong> Avoids eigendecomposition entirely:
                    \[
                    T_k(x) = 2xT_{k-1}(x) - T_{k-2}(x)
                    \]
                    Used in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for scalable spectral filtering

                <li><strong>Random Projection Methods:</strong> Johnson-Lindenstrauss based approaches for approximate embeddings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Modern Applications Beyond Clustering</h3>
            <p>
                Graph Laplacians are fundamental to many 2025 AI applications:
            </p>

            <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Graph Neural Networks:</strong> GCN uses \(\tilde{L} = I - D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}\) for message passing</li>
                <li><strong>Recommender Systems:</strong> Netflix/YouTube use spectral methods on user-item graphs</li>
                <li><strong>Protein Structure:</strong> AlphaFold uses graph representations with Laplacian-based features</li>
                <li><strong>Social Network Analysis:</strong> Community detection via spectral clustering at Facebook/LinkedIn scale</li>

            </ul>
