                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                    In our journey through abstract algebra, we intentionally bypassed <strong>dihedral groups</strong> until now. 
                    While many textbooks lead with these visual examples, they often create a conceptual gap when the curriculum 
                    shifts toward the pure logic of ring and field theory. We prioritized the <strong>underlying algebraic structures</strong> 
                    first. Now that we have established a rigorous foundation, we return to these geometric groups not as mere "examples," 
                    but as the definitive <strong>implementation</strong> of the structures we've mastered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mathematics is essentially the <strong>study of structure</strong>. In the digital world, we often begin with discrete, 
                    "clicky" rules — like the way a hexagonal tile on this map fits into its neighbor. 
                    This is the realm of <strong>dihedral groups \(D_n\)</strong>, where only specific rotations and reflections are allowed 
                    to preserve the shape.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But as we move toward the physical reality of robotics, and 3D graphics, these rigid steps must become fluid. 
                    By taking the limit of these discrete steps, we transition into the continuous world of <strong>Lie groups</strong>:

                        <strong>\(SO(3)\) (Special Orthogonal Group):</strong><br>
                        The mathematics of pure rotation, where the "volume" or <strong>measure</strong> of an object remains invariant 
                        no matter how you turn it.

                <h2>Dihedral Groups</h2>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Dihedral Groups</span>
                    <p>
                    The <strong>dihedral group</strong> \(D_n\) is the group of symmetries of a regular \(n\)-gon \(n \geq 3\)
                    It has order \(2n\) and is generated by two fundamental operations:      
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rotation (\(r\)):</strong> A rotation by \(\frac{2\pi}{n}\) radians.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflection (\(s\)):</strong> A reflection across a fixed axis passing through the center.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p>
                        These generators satisfy the following relations, which define the algebraic structure of the group:
                        \[ 
                        D_n = \langle r, s \mid r^n = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{-1} \rangle 
                        \]
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    One of the most critical features of \(D_n\) is that it is <strong>non-Abelian</strong>. 
                    This means the order of operations matters:
                    \[
                     rs \neq sr.
                     \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, the relation \(srs = r^{-1}\) (or equivalently \(sr = r^{-1}s\)) tells us that 
                    "reflecting then rotating" is the same as "rotating in the opposite direction then reflecting." 
                    This non-commutativity is the reason why 3D orientation in CS and Robotics cannot be handled with 
                    simple addition — it requires <strong>matrix multiplication</strong>.
                </p>
                            
                <p>
                    <strong>The Illusion of "Rotation"</strong><br>
                    In a discrete world, the term "rotation" is actually a bit misleading. Unlike a physical wheel that turns 
                    through every intermediate angle, a Dihedral Group \(D_n\) has <strong>no "in-between" states</strong>. 
                    There is no \(1^\circ\) or \(15.5^\circ\); there is only the <em>instantaneous leap</em> from one valid 
                    configuration to the next. 
                    <br><br>
                    Think of it as a <strong>permutation of states</strong> rather than a movement. When you click the buttons below, 
                    notice that the hexagon doesn't "spin" — it simply <em>re-appears</em> in a new orientation that preserves its 
                    structure. This is the hallmark of finite, discrete symmetry.
                </p>

                <p >
                    <strong>From Permutations to Flow: The Continuum</strong><br>
                    Now, imagine increasing the number of sides of our hexagon toward infinity until it becomes a perfect circle — 
                    or in 3D, a sphere. 
                    The "clicky" gaps disappear, and we enter the realm of <strong>continuous groups (Lie groups)</strong>. 
                    <br>
                    In \(SO(3)\), rotation is no longer a jump between states, but a smooth, differentiable <strong>flow</strong>. 
                    As you drag the model below, notice how the transformation matrix changes by infinitesimal increments. 
                    Despite this fluidity, one thing remains rock-solid: the <strong>determinant is always 1.0</strong>. 
                    This is the mathematical proof that the object's volume (measure) is never distorted, no matter how 
                    complex the rotation.

                <p>
                    <strong>Beyond Pure Rotation: The Geometry of Reality</strong><br>
                    In the abstract world, we can rotate an object around its origin forever. But in the physical world of robotics 
                    and engineering, objects also <strong>move</strong> through space. By combining the rotations of \(SO(3)\) with 
                    3D <strong>translation</strong>, we arrive at the <strong>special euclidean group \(SE(3)\)</strong>.
                    <br>
                    This "practical" group describes the <strong>rigid body motion</strong> — the way a drone flies or a robot arm 
                    reaches for a tool. Pay close attention to the \(4 \times 4\) matrix: it encodes both "where it is" and "how it is facing" 
                    into a single, elegant structure. Unlike simple addition, the order of these operations matters (non-commutativity), 
                    reflecting the true complexity of navigating a 3D manifold.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that the <strong>degrees of freedom (DoF)</strong> equal the <strong>dimension of the manifold</strong>, 
                    making \(SO(3)\) a 3-dimensional manifold and \(SE(3)\) a 6-dimensional manifold.

                <h2>The Path Ahead: Toward Manifolds and Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    In this page, we have witnessed a fundamental shift: from the <strong>instantaneous leaps</strong> of dihedral groups 
                    to the <strong>continuous flows</strong> of \(SO(3)\) and \(SE(3)\). This transition is more than just a visual change — it
                     is the point where <strong>abstract algebra</strong> meets <strong>mathematical analysis</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we treat these groups not just as sets of operations, but as <strong>smooth geometric shapes</strong> 
                    in their own right, we enter the domain of <strong>Lie theory</strong>. Here, the group itself becomes a 
                    <strong>differentiable manifold</strong>. The "structure" we've studied is no longer just about permutations; 
                    it becomes about curvature, tangents, and the shortest paths (geodesics) across space.
                </p>
