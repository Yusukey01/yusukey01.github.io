                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                    In our journey through Abstract Algebra, we intentionally bypassed <strong>Dihedral Groups</strong> until now. 
                    While many textbooks lead with these visual examples, they often create a conceptual gap when the curriculum 
                    shifts toward the pure logic of Ring and Field Theory. We prioritized the <strong>underlying algebraic structures</strong> 
                    first. Now that we have established a rigorous foundation, we return to these geometric groups not as mere "examples," 
                    but as the definitive <strong>implementation</strong> of the structures we've mastered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mathematics is essentially the <strong>study of structure</strong>. In the digital world, we often begin with discrete, 
                    "clicky" rules — like the way a hexagonal tile on this map fits into its neighbor. 
                    This is the realm of <strong>Dihedral Groups \(D_n\)</strong>, where only specific rotations and reflections are allowed 
                    to preserve the shape.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But as we move toward the physical reality of robotics, and 3D graphics, these rigid steps must become fluid. 
                    By taking the limit of these discrete steps, we transition into the continuous world of <strong>Lie Groups</strong>:

                    <li>
                        <strong>\(SO(3)\) (Special Orthogonal Group):</strong><br>
                        The mathematics of pure rotation, where the "volume" or <strong>measure</strong> of an object remains invariant 
                        no matter how you turn it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>\(SE(3)\) (Special Euclidean Group):</strong><br>
                        The full description of rigid body motion in 3D space, combining rotation with <strong>translation</strong> 
                        — the fundamental "language" for any system navigating the real world.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    of spatial <strong>manifolds</strong>.

                <p>
                    The journey doesn't end with rigid transformations. The real power of these concepts emerges when we merge 
                    <strong>Abstract Algebra</strong> with <strong>Mathematical Analysis</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By treating groups like \(SO(3)\) and \(SE(3)\) as smooth geometric shapes themselves, 
                    we enter the world of <strong>Differentiable Manifolds</strong> and <strong>Lie Theory</strong>. 
                    This is where we transition from "moving an object" to "calculating the shortest path (geodesic) 
                    on a curved space."
