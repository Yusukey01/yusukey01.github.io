                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    In physics, a <strong>Field</strong> — such as a magnetic field — is defined by its influence. It is a region of 
                    space where physical forces are felt. While it is naturally bounded by its own reach, its primary characteristic 
                    is the distribution of energy across a coordinate system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In mathematics, the term <strong>Field</strong> carries a different weight. Its original German name, <strong>Körper</strong>, 
                    literally means <strong>'Body'</strong> or <strong>'Organization.'</strong> This describes a system defined not by its reach 
                    in space, but by its internal symmetry. It is a structure so structurally complete that its arithmetic — addition, subtraction, 
                    multiplication, and division — can never escape its own boundaries.
                </p>            

                <p>
                    The limitation of such a perfect "Body" is its inability to spontaneously evolve. If a field cannot solve a specific polynomial 
                    equation — like the Real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\) failing to solve \(x^2 + 1 = 0\) — it has no "internal logic" to find the answer. 
                    It is trapped by the very completeness that makes it a field.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To progress, we must perform a mathematical "transplant." We must force this closed organization open and graft new dimensions 
                    onto its structure. This process of expanding a perfect system into a larger, more capable universe is what we call 
                    <strong>Extension Fields</strong>.
