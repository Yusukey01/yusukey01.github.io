                    In the previous pages, we studied the internal structure of individual groups: cyclic groups, 
                    symmetric groups, cosets, and factor groups. Now we shift our focus from <strong>analysis</strong> 
                    to <strong>synthesis</strong>. We now ask: How can we build large, complex groups 
                    from small, simple ones? And how can we tell when a group is built from simpler pieces?

                    Given two groups, we can construct a new group by taking all ordered pairs and defining 
                    the operation componentwise. This construction is called the <strong>external direct product</strong>.

                    of \(G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_n\), written as \(G_1 \times G_2 \times \cdots \times G_n\), is the set of all

                    The operation is defined componentwise:

                <h2>Order of Elements in Direct Products</h2>

                <p>
                    Once we can build direct products, a natural question is: what is the order of an element 
                    \((g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)\)? The answer turns out to be the least common multiple of the 
                    individual orders.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Order in Direct Products</span>  
                    The order of an element \((g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)\) in \(G_1 \times G_2 \times \cdots \times G_n\) is
                    \[
                    |(g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)| = \text{lcm}(|g_1|, |g_2|, \ldots, |g_n|).
                    \]
                </div>

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                    <p>
                        Let \(s = |(g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)|\) and \(t = \text{lcm}(|g_1|, |g_2|, \ldots, |g_n|)\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since \(t\) is a multiple of each \(|g_i|\), we have \(g_i^t = e_i\) for all \(i\). Thus:
                        \[
                        (g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)^t = (g_1^t, g_2^t, \ldots, g_n^t) = (e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n).
                        \]
                        This means \(s \mid t\) (i.e., \(s\) divides \(t\)).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conversely, \((g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)^s = (e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n)\) implies \(g_i^s = e_i\) 
                        for all \(i\). Thus \(|g_i| \mid s\) for all \(i\), so \(t \mid s\).

                    Sometimes the direct product of two cyclic groups is again cyclic, and sometimes it isn't. 
                    The key turns out to be whether the orders are relatively prime.

                    Let \(G\) and \(H\) be finite cyclic groups. Then \(G \times H\) is cyclic if and only if 
                    \(|G|\) and \(|H|\) are relatively prime.

                        \((\Rightarrow)\):
                        <br>
                        Suppose \(G \times H\) is cyclic with \(|G| = m\) and \(|H| = n\), so that \(|G \times H| = mn\). 
                        We must show that \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime. 
                        Suppose that \(\text{gcd}(m ,n) = d\) and \((g, h)\) is a generator of \(G \times H\). Since 
                        \[
                        (g, h)^{\frac{mn}{d}} = \left((g^m)^{\frac{n}{d}}, (h^n)^{\frac{m}{d}}\right) = (e, e),

                    This is the group-theoretic version of the <strong>Chinese Remainder Theorem</strong> from number theory. 
                    In number theory, the CRT states that if \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\), then for any integers \(a, b\), 
                    the system of congruences \(x \equiv a \pmod{m}\), \(x \equiv b \pmod{n}\) has a unique solution modulo \(mn\). 
                    The group version says that the map
                    \[
                    \phi: \mathbb{Z}_{mn} \to \mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n, \quad \phi(x) = (x \bmod m, \, x \bmod n)
                    \]
                    is not only a bijection (number theory CRT) but also a group isomorphism.

                    Indeed, we can represent any \(U\)-group as an external direct product of cyclic groups.

                    product of cyclic groups. The decomposition relies on a result proved by Gauss:

                        For \(p\) an odd prime and \(n \geq 1\),
                        \[

                 <p>
                    This decomposition is useful because it lets us answer "structural" questions easily. 
                    For instance, is \(U(105)\) cyclic? 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that \(U(105)\) and \(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_6\) are 
                    <strong>not equal</strong> as sets — their elements look completely different:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>\(U(105) = \{1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 13, \ldots\}\) (integers coprime to 105)</li>
                    <li>\(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_6 = \{(0,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,2,3), \ldots\}\) (tuples)</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>
                    However, since they are <strong>isomorphic</strong>, they share the same algebraic structure. 
                    Any structural property we determine from \(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_6\) 
                    applies to \(U(105)\) as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So we check whether the orders 2, 4, 6 are pairwise relatively prime:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>\(\gcd(2, 4) = 2 \neq 1\)</li>
                    <li>\(\gcd(2, 6) = 2 \neq 1\)</li>
                    <li>\(\gcd(4, 6) = 2 \neq 1\)</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>
                    Since the orders are not pairwise relatively prime, the product 
                    \(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_6\) is not cyclic. 
                    Therefore, \(U(105)\) is <strong>not cyclic</strong> either.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can also find the maximum order of any element in \(U(105)\). Using the decomposition:
                    \[
                    \text{Maximum order} = \text{lcm}(2, 4, 6) = 12.
                    \]
                    This means no element in \(U(105)\) has order greater than 12.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Compare this to finding the maximum order directly from \(U(105)\):
                </p>
                <ol style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>List all 48 elements of \(U(105) = \{1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, \ldots\}\)</li>
                    <li>For each element \(a\), compute \(a^1, a^2, a^3, \ldots \pmod{105}\) until reaching 1</li>
                    <li>Track the maximum order found</li>
                </ol><br>
                <p>
                    This requires many modular exponentiations — tedious by hand and slow computationally. 
                    The decomposition gives the answer in one line.

                    In cryptography, this maximum order is called the <strong>exponent</strong> of the group. 
                    It determines how many times an operation must be applied before every element returns to 
                    the identity. For systems like RSA, understanding the group exponent 
                    is essential for security analysis.

                <h2>Internal Direct Products</h2>

                <p>
                    External direct products let us <em>build</em> new groups from existing ones. But what about 
                    the reverse? Given a group \(G\), can we tell if it's really just a direct product of its 
                    own subgroups in disguise?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's the difference: when we write \(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3\), we're constructing 
                    something new from two separate groups. But when we discover that \(U(8) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2\), 
                    we're saying that a group we already have breaks apart into simpler pieces. The 
                    <strong>internal direct product</strong> tells us exactly when this decomposition works.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Internal Direct Product</span>  
                    We say that a group \(G\) is the <strong>internal direct product</strong> of subgroups 
                    \(H\) and \(K\), written \(G = H \times K\), if:
                    <ol style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>\(H\) and \(K\) are normal subgroups of \(G\),</li>
                        <li>\(G = HK = \{hk \mid h \in H, k \in K\}\),</li>
                        <li>\(H \cap K = \{e\}\).</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The three conditions capture the essential requirements: normality ensures that the 
                    product \(HK\) forms a subgroup, the second condition ensures coverage of all elements, 
                    and the trivial intersection ensures that each element of \(G\) has a unique factorization 
                    as a product \(hk\) with \(h \in H\) and \(k \in K\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Note on notation:</strong><br>
                    We use the same symbol \(\times\) for both external and internal direct products. 
                    Context tells us which is meant: if \(H\) and \(K\) are subgroups of \(G\), it's internal; 
                    if they are "separate" groups, it's external. This shared notation reflects the fact that 
                    if \(G\) is the internal direct product of \(H\) and \(K\), then \(G\) is isomorphic to 
                    the external direct product \(H \times K\). The two constructions yield the same group structure.

                    If a group \(G\) is the internal direct product of a finite number of subgroups \(H_1, H_2, \cdots, H_n\), 
                    then \(G\) is isomorphic to the external direct product of  \(H_1, H_2, \cdots, H_n\).

                        \(\phi(h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n) = h_1 h_2 \cdots h_n\),

                    <p>
                        <strong>Onto:</strong> By condition 2, every element of \(G\) can be 
                        written as \(h_1 h_2 \cdots h_n\) for some \(h_i \in H_i\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>One-to-one:</strong> Suppose \(\phi(h_1, \ldots, h_n) = \phi(h'_1, \ldots, h'_n)\), 
                        i.e., \(h_1 \cdots h_n = h'_1 \cdots h'_n\). 
                        By condition 3, the representation of each element as a product \(h_1 h_2 \cdots h_n\) 
                        is unique, so \(h_i = h'_i\) for all \(i\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Homomorphism:</strong> We need elements from different \(H_i\) to commute. 
                        Let \(h \in H_i\) and \(k \in H_j\) with \(i \neq j\). Consider the commutator 
                        \([h, k] = hkh^{-1}k^{-1}\). 
                        Since \(H_j \trianglelefteq G\), we have \(hkh^{-1} \in H_j\), so \([h,k] = (hkh^{-1})k^{-1} \in H_j\).
                        Since \(H_i \trianglelefteq G\), we have \(kh^{-1}k^{-1} \in H_i\), so \([h,k] = h(kh^{-1}k^{-1}) \in H_i\).
                        Thus \([h,k] \in H_i \cap H_j = \{e\}\), which gives \(hk = kh\).

                    <p>
                        Therefore, we can rearrange:
                        \[
                        \phi(h_1 h'_1, \ldots, h_n h'_n) = h_1 h'_1 \cdots h_n h'_n = h_1 \cdots h_n \cdot h'_1 \cdots h'_n = \phi(h_1, \ldots, h_n)\phi(h'_1, \ldots, h'_n).
                        \]
                    </p>

                    <span class="proof-title">Example: \(U(105)\) as an Internal Direct Product</span>
                    <p>
                        Recall that \(U(105) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_6\). 
                        This isomorphism arises because \(U(105)\) is the internal direct product of three subgroups:
                        \[
                        U(105) = U_{35}(105) \times U_{21}(105) \times U_{15}(105)
                        \]
                        where
                        \[
                        U_{35}(105) = \{1, 71\}, \quad U_{21}(105) = \{1, 22, 43, 64\}, \quad U_{15}(105) = \{1, 16, 31, 46, 61, 76\}.
                        \]
                        These subgroups satisfy the three conditions: each is normal (since \(U(105)\) is Abelian), 
                        their product gives all of \(U(105)\), and they have pairwise trivial intersections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This decomposition makes it easy to find subgroups of \(U(105)\) with a specific order. 
                        Since subgroups of a direct product come from subgroups of the factors, we just need to 
                        find factor orders that multiply to the desired order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, to find subgroups of order 12 in \(U(105)\), we look for divisors 
                        \(d_1 | 2\), \(d_2 | 4\), \(d_3 | 6\) with \(d_1 \cdot d_2 \cdot d_3 = 12\):

                <h2>Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups</h2>

                <p>
                    Now we come to one of the most elegant results in algebra. The 
                    <strong>Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups</strong> says that every 
                    finite Abelian group is just a direct product of cyclic groups — no exceptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We already used this idea when we decomposed :
                    \[
                    U(105) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_6
                    \]
                    Now we state the theorem precisely.

                    Every  finite Abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order. Moreover, 
                    the number of terms in the product and the orders of the cyclic groups are uniquely determined 
                    by the group.

                <p>
                    Recall a cyclic group of order \(n\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_n\), The theorem says that every finite 
                    Abeian group can be written as: 
                    \[
                     G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{a_1}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_2^{a_2}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_k^{a_k}}
                    \]
                    where the \(p_i\)'s are not necessarily distinct primes and the prime powers \(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k\) 
                    are uniquely determined by \(G\) and called elementary divisors of \(G\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The proof proceeds in four steps, each captured by a lemma. Understanding the logical flow 
                    helps clarify why each piece is necessary:

                    <li>
                        <strong>Lemma 1 (Primary Decomposition):</strong><br>
                        We first show that any finite Abelian group splits into a direct product of subgroups of prime-power order. 
                        This reduces the problem: instead of classifying all finite Abelian groups, we only need to classify 
                        Abelian \(p\)-groups (groups whose order is a power of a single prime \(p\)).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lemma 2 (Extraction Lemma):</strong><br>
                        For an Abelian \(p\)-group, we show that if we take an element of maximum order, we can "factor it 
                        out" — the group decomposes as a direct product of the cyclic subgroup generated by that element and 
                        some complementary subgroup. This is the key inductive step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lemma 3 (Existence):</strong><br>
                        Applying Lemma 2 repeatedly, we conclude that every Abelian \(p\)-group is a direct product of cyclic groups. 
                        Combined with Lemma 1, this establishes that every finite Abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lemma 4 (Uniqueness):</strong><br>
                        Finally, we prove that this decomposition is unique — the list of prime-power orders appearing in the 
                        factorization is determined by the group itself, independent of how we perform the decomposition.
                    </li>
                </ol><br>

                <p>
                    Together, Lemmas 1-3 prove <strong>existence</strong> (every finite Abelian group has such a decomposition), 
                    and Lemma 4 proves <strong>uniqueness</strong> (the decomposition is essentially the only one).

                    Let \(G\) be a finite Abelian group of order \(p^n m\), where \(p\) is a prime that does not divide \(m\). Then 
                    \(G = H \times K\), where 
                    \[
                    H = \{x \in G \mid x^{p^n} = e\} \quad \text{and} \quad K = \{x \in G \mid x^m = e\}.

                    This lemma says we can separate elements by their "prime character." The subgroup \(H\) collects 
                    all elements whose orders are powers of \(p\), while \(K\) collects elements whose orders divide \(m\) 
                    (and hence are coprime to \(p\)).

                        It is straightforward to verify that \(H\) and \(K\) are subgroups of \(G\) using the 
                        one-step subgroup test (since \(G\) is Abelian, \((xy^{-1})^{p^n} = x^{p^n}(y^{-1})^{p^n} = e\) 
                        whenever \(x, y \in H\), and similarly for \(K\)).

                    <p>
                        Because \(G\) is Abelian, to prove that \(G = H \times K\), we need only show that 
                        \(G = HK\) and \(H \cap K = \{e\}\).

                        Since \(\gcd(m, p^n) = 1\), there exist integers \(s\) and \(t\) such that \(1 = sm + tp^n\). 
                        For any \(x \in G\), we have:
                        \[
                        x = x^1 = x^{sm + tp^n} = x^{sm} \cdot x^{tp^n}.
                        \]
                        Now, since \(|G| = p^n m\), by Lagrange's theorem we have \(x^{|G|} = e\) for all \(x \in G\). 
                        Therefore:
                        \[
                        (x^{sm})^{p^n} = x^{smp^n} = x^{s |G|} = (x^{|G|})^s = e,
                        \]
                        so \(x^{sm} \in H\). Similarly, 
                        \[
                        (x^{tp^n})^m = x^{tp^n m} = x^{t |G|} = (x^{|G|})^t = e,
                        \]
                        so \(x^{tp^n} \in K\). Thus \(x = x^{sm} \cdot x^{tp^n} \in HK\), and we conclude \(G = HK\).

                        Suppose \(x \in H \cap K\). Then \(x^{p^n} = e\) and \(x^m = e\), so \(|x|\) divides both 
                        \(p^n\) and \(m\). 
                        <br>
                        (Note: For any group element \(a\), \(a^k = e\) if and only if \(|a|\) divides \(k\).)
                        <br>
                        Since \(p\) does not divide \(m\), we have \(\gcd(p^n, m) = 1\), 
                        which forces \(|x| = 1\). Therefore \(x = e\).

                        <strong>Showing \(|H| = p^n\):</strong><br>
                        Since \(H \cap K = \{e\}\), we have
                        \[
                        |HK| = |H||K| / |H \cap K| = |H||K|.
                        \]
                        Since \(G = HK\), we get \(p^n m = |H||K|\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now we determine what \(|H|\) and \(|K|\) must be. Consider any element \(x \in H\). 
                        By definition of \(H\), we have \(x^{p^n} = e\), so \(|x|\) divides \(p^n\). This means 
                        every element of \(H\) has order that is a power of \(p\). By Lagrange's theorem, 
                        \(|x|\) divides \(|H|\) for all \(x \in H\), and since all element orders are powers of \(p\), 
                        the group order \(|H|\) must also be a power of \(p\). (If a prime \(q \neq p\) divided \(|H|\), 
                        then by Cauchy's theorem of Abelian groups, \(H\) would contain an element of order \(q\), contradicting 
                        the fact that all elements of \(H\) have orders dividing \(p^n\).)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, every element \(x \in K\) satisfies \(x^m = e\), so \(|x|\) divides \(m\). 
                        Since \(p\) does not divide \(m\), no element of \(K\) can have order divisible by \(p\). 
                        By the same reasoning (Cauchy's theorem), \(p\) does not divide \(|K|\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now we can determine \(|H|\). We know \(|H| = p^k\) for some \(k \leq n\), and 
                        \(|H||K| = p^n m\), so \(|K| = p^{n-k} m\). But since \(p\) does not divide \(|K|\), 
                        we must have \(n - k = 0\), i.e., \(k = n\). Therefore \(|H| = p^n\) and \(|K| = m\).

               <p>
                    By applying Lemma 1 repeatedly, we can decompose any finite Abelian group into a direct product of 
                    subgroups of prime-power order. Given an Abelian group \(G\) with 
                    \(|G| = p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} \cdots p_k^{n_k}\) where the \(p_i\)'s are distinct primes, 
                    let \(G(p_i) = \{x \in G \mid x^{p_i^{n_i}} = e\}\). Then by Lemma 1 and induction:
                    \[
                    G = G(p_1) \times G(p_2) \times \cdots \times G(p_k) \quad \text{with } |G(p_i)| = p_i^{n_i}.
                    \]
                    This reduces our problem to understanding Abelian groups of prime-power order.

                    <p>
                        <em>Proof of Claim:</em> 
                        Since \(|b^p| = |b|/p\), we know that \(b^p \in \langle a \rangle\) by the minimality of \(|b|\) 
                        (if \(b^p \notin \langle a \rangle\), then \(b^p\) would be an element outside \(\langle a \rangle\) 
                        with smaller order than \(b\), a contradiction). Say \(b^p = a^i\) for some integer \(i\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now observe:
                        \[
                        e = b^{p^m} = (b^p)^{p^{m-1}} = (a^i)^{p^{m-1}} = a^{i \cdot p^{m-1}},
                        \]
                        so \(|a| = p^m\) divides \(i \cdot p^{m-1}\). This means \(|a^i| \leq p^{m-1}\), so \(a^i\) is not a 
                        generator of \(\langle a \rangle\). By the theory of cyclic groups, \(\gcd(p^m, i) \neq 1\), 
                        which means \(p\) divides \(i\). Write \(i = pj\) for some integer \(j\).

                    <p>
                        Consider the element \(c = a^{-j}b\). Since \(b \notin \langle a \rangle\), certainly 
                        \(c \notin \langle a \rangle\) (for if \(c \in \langle a \rangle\), then \(b = a^j c \in \langle a \rangle\), 
                        a contradiction). Also:
                        \[
                        c^p = (a^{-j})^p \cdot b^p = a^{-pj} \cdot b^p = a^{-i} \cdot b^p = b^{-p} \cdot b^p = e.
                        \]
                        So \(c\) is an element of order \(p\) that lies outside \(\langle a \rangle\). Since \(b\) was chosen 
                        to have smallest order among elements outside \(\langle a \rangle\), we conclude \(|b| \leq |c| = p\), 
                        hence \(|b| = p\).

                    <p>
                        Now, \(\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle\) is a subgroup of both \(\langle a \rangle\) and 
                        \(\langle b \rangle\). Since \(|\langle b \rangle| = p\) is prime, either 
                        \(\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}\) or \(\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \langle b \rangle\). 
                        The latter would mean \(b \in \langle a \rangle\), contradicting \(b \notin \langle a \rangle\). 
                        Therefore \(\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}\), proving the claim.

                        Consider the quotient group \(\overline{G} = G/\langle b \rangle\). Let \(\overline{x}\) denote the

                    <p>
                        We claim that \(|\overline{a}| = |a| = p^m\). 
                        If \(|\overline{a}| < |a| = p^m\), then \(\overline{a}^{p^{m-1}} = \overline{e}\). 
                        This means that \((a\langle b \rangle)^{p^{m-1}} = a^{p^{m-1}} \langle b \rangle = \langle b \rangle\), so that 
                        \(a^{p^{m-1}} \in \langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}\), 
                        contradicting the fact that \(|a| = p^m\). Thus, \(|\overline{a}| = |a| = p^m\), and therefore 
                        \(\overline{a}\) is an element of maximum order in \(\overline{G}\).

                    <p>
                        By induction, we know that \(\overline{G}\) can be written in the form 
                        \(\langle \overline{a} \rangle \times \overline{K}\) for some subgroup \(\overline{K}\) of \(\overline{G}\).

                   <p>
                        Let \(K\) be the pullback of \(\overline{K}\) under the natural homomorphism from \(G\) to \(\overline{G}\) 
                        (i.e., \(K = \{x \in G \mid \overline{x} \in \overline{K}\}\)). Note that \(\langle b \rangle \subseteq K\) since 
                        \(\overline{b} = \overline{e} \in \overline{K}\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We claim \(\langle a \rangle \cap K = \{e\}\). For if \(x \in \langle a \rangle \cap K\), then 
                        \(\overline{x} \in \langle \overline{a} \rangle \cap \overline{K} = \{\overline{e}\}\), 
                        which means \(x \in \langle b \rangle\). Thus \(x \in \langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now we show \(G = \langle a \rangle K\) using an order argument. Since \(\langle b \rangle \subseteq K\), 
                        we have \(|K| = |\overline{K}| \cdot |\langle b \rangle| = |\overline{K}| \cdot p\). 
                        Since \(\langle a \rangle \cap K = \{e\}\):
                        \[
                        |\langle a \rangle K| = \frac{|\langle a \rangle| \cdot |K|}{|\langle a \rangle \cap K|} 
                        = |\langle a \rangle| \cdot |K| = p^m \cdot |\overline{K}| \cdot p.
                        \]
                        From \(\overline{G} = \langle \overline{a} \rangle \times \overline{K}\), we have 
                        \(|\overline{G}| = |\langle \overline{a} \rangle| \cdot |\overline{K}| = p^m \cdot |\overline{K}|\). 
                        Since \(|\overline{G}| = |G|/p = p^{n-1}\), we get \(|\overline{K}| = p^{n-1}/p^m = p^{n-1-m}\). 
                        Therefore:
                        \[
                        |\langle a \rangle K| = p^m \cdot p^{n-1-m} \cdot p = p^n = |G|.
                        \]
                        Thus \(G = \langle a \rangle K\), and since \(\langle a \rangle \cap K = \{e\}\), we conclude 
                        \(G = \langle a \rangle \times K\).

                        For any Abelian group \(L\), the set \(L^p = \{x^p \mid x \in L\}\) is a subgroup of \(L\). 
                        It follows that:
                        \[
                        G^p = H_1^p \times H_2^p \times \cdots \times H_m^p
                        \]
                        is a proper subgroup of \(G\) when \(|G| > p\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let \(m'\) be the number of \(H_i\)'s with \(|H_i| > p\), and let \(n'\) be the number of 
                        \(K_j\)'s with \(|K_j| > p\). For \(|H_i| > p\), we have \(|H_i^p| = |H_i|/p > 1\), so 
                        \(H_i^p\) is nontrivial. For \(|H_i| = p\), we have \(H_i^p = \{e\}\). Thus the nontrivial 
                        factors in the decomposition of \(G^p\) are exactly \(H_1^p, \ldots, H_{m'}^p\) 
                        (assuming the \(H_i\)'s are ordered by decreasing size). Similarly for the \(K\)'s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since \(|G^p| < |G|\), by the induction hypothesis applied to \(G^p\), we have \(m' = n'\) 
                        and \(|H_i^p| = |K_i^p|\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, m'\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since \(|H_i^p| = |H_i|/p\) and \(|K_i^p| = |K_i|/p\) for these indices, this proves 
                        that \(|H_i| = |K_i|\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, m'\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All that remains is to show that the number of factors of order \(p\) is the same in both 
                        decompositions, i.e., \(m - m' = n - n'\). Since:
                        \[
                        |G| = |H_1| \cdots |H_m| = |K_1| \cdots |K_n|
                        \]
                        and the factors \(|H_1|, \ldots, |H_{m'}|\) match \(|K_1|, \ldots, |K_{n'}|\) respectively 
                        (with \(m' = n'\)), we have:
                        \[
                        p^{m - m'} = p^{n - n'},
                        \]
                        hence \(m - m' = n - n'\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore \(m = n\), and \(|H_i| = |K_i|\) for all \(i\).
                    </p>

                    This completes the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. The four lemmas together 
                    show that every finite Abelian group has a unique (up to reordering) decomposition into cyclic groups 
                    of prime-power order.

                <h3>Using the Theorem</h3>

                <p>
                    Let's see how to use the theorem. To find all Abelian groups of a given order, 
                    we look at how that order factors into prime powers.

                        Therefore, there are exactly <strong>six</strong> non-isomorphic Abelian groups of order 72.

                    In general, if \(n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_r^{a_r}\), then the number of non-isomorphic 
                    Abelian groups of order \(n\) is:
                    \[
                    p(a_1) \cdot p(a_2) \cdots p(a_r)

                        In the RSA cryptosystem (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, 1978), we work in \(U(n)\) where \(n = pq\) 
                        for large primes \(p, q\). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem for groups:
                        \[
                        U(pq) \cong U(p) \times U(q) \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p-1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{q-1}.
                        \]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This decomposition enables <strong>CRT-based RSA decryption</strong>, a standard optimization 
                        used in practice. Instead of computing \(m = c^d \bmod n\) directly with the large private 
                        exponent \(d\), we compute separately:
                        \[
                        m_p = c^{d_p} \bmod p, \quad m_q = c^{d_q} \bmod q
                        \]
                        where \(d_p = d \bmod (p-1)\) and \(d_q = d \bmod (q-1)\) are much smaller exponents. 
                        The results are then combined using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to obtain \(m \bmod n\). 
                        This method provides significant speedup in RSA decryption and signature generation.

                    The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups provides a complete classification: 
                    every finite Abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order. 
                    Combined with the tools from this page — external and internal direct products, the 
                    Chinese Remainder Theorem, and the cyclic criterion — we can decompose groups like 
                    \(U(n)\), determine their structure, find subgroups of specific orders, and compute 
                    maximum element orders efficiently. These techniques form the foundation for applications 
                    in cryptography, coding theory, and algorithm design. In the next section, we move beyond 
                    groups to study <strong>rings</strong> and <strong>fields</strong>.
