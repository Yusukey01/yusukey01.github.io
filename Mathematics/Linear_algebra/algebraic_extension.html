                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                    In the previous chapter, we stood at a crossroads. Having established that we can always expand a field to find the roots of a polynomial, 
                    we must now ask: <em>how do we measure the "size" or the "degrees of freedom" of this new, extended universe?</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    We now take the path toward continuous symmetry and geometry. Before we can understand the smooth, infinite dimensions of Lie groups and manifolds 
                    used in modern AI, we must first understand dimension in its purest, discrete algebraic form. When we adjoin a new element to a field, we are 
                    effectively adding a new "dimension" to a vector space.

                    <p>
                        In robotics and 3D computer vision, we constantly track <em>degrees of freedom</em> (for instance, a rigid body in \(SE(3)\) has 6 degrees of freedom). 
                        In abstract algebra, the "degree of an extension" tracks the exact dimensionality of a new field over its base. The rules governing how these discrete 
                        dimensions stack and multiply - specifically the <strong>Tower Rule</strong> - are the rigorous mathematical ancestors of dimension counting in the smooth 
                        manifolds and Lie groups we will study next.

                <p>
                    When we expand a base field \(F\) by adding a new element \(a\) to create an extension \(E\), the structure of this new universe 
                    depends entirely on the nature of \(a\). Specifically, we must ask if \(a\) is bound by the algebraic rules of \(F\), or if it is 
                    entirely independent.

                        Let \(E\) be an extension field of a field \(F\). Then \(a \in E\) is called:

                            <strong>algebraic</strong> over \(F\) if \(a\) is the zero of some nonzero polynomial in \(F[x]\).

                        </li>

                    <p>
                        An extension \(E\) of \(F\) is called an <strong>algebraic extension</strong> of \(F\) if every element of 
                        \(E\) is algebraic over \(F\). If \(E\) is not an algebraic extension of \(F\), it is called 
                        <strong>transcendental extension</strong> of \(F\). Also, an extension of \(F\) of the form \(F(a)\) is called 
                        a <strong>simple extension</strong> of \(F\).

                    If an element is algebraic (like \(\sqrt{2}\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\)), it brings a finite, measurable amount of new information 
                    to the field. If it is transcendental (like \(\pi\) or \(e\)), it brings an infinite number of linear independent powers, 
                    blowing the dimension of the field up to infinity. Because we are building toward the study of finite-dimensional continuous 
                    groups, we care deeply about the <strong>algebraic</strong> case.

                        Let \(E\) be an extension field of the field \(F\) and let \(a \in E\). If \(a\) is transcendental over \(F\), then

                        If \(a\) is algebraic over \(F\), then \(F(a) \cong F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle\), where \(p(x)\) is the 
                        unique monic irreducible polynomial in \(F[x]\) of minimal degree such that \(p(a) = 0\).

                    As established in the previous chapter, this isomorphism gives us a concrete data structure. But more importantly, 
                    it implies a strict limit on the size of the new field. This brings us to the most crucial property of algebraic extensions: 
                    their vector space dimension.

                <p>
                    Here, abstract algebra beautifully intersects with Linear Algebra. Any extension field \(E\) can simply be viewed as a 
                    <strong>vector space</strong> over its base field \(F\). For example, the complex numbers \(\mathbb{C}\) form a 2-dimensional 
                    vector space over the real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\), with the basis \(\{1, i\}\).
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Degree of an Extension</span>
                    <p>
                        Let \(E\) be an extension field of a field \(F\). If \(E\) has dimension \(n\) as a vector space over \(F\), 
                        \(E\) has <strong>degree</strong> \(n\) over \(F\) and write 
                        \[
                        [E:F] = n.
                        \]
                        If \([E:F]\) is finite, \(E\) is called a <strong>finite extension</strong> of \(F\), and if not, \(E\) is called 
                        an <strong>infinite extension</strong> of \(F\).
                    </p>

                <p>
                    A powerful realization is that restricting the vector space dimension strictly forces all elements inside the field to be algebraic. 
                    There is simply not enough "room" in a finite-dimensional space for an element to be transcendental.

                    Imagine, if the vector space dimension is \(n\), then any sequence of \(n+1\) elements must be linearly dependent. 
                    For any element \(a \in E\), the \(n+1\) powers \(\{1, a, a^2, \dots, a^n\}\) must have some linear dependence relation 
                    \(c_0 + c_1a + \dots + c_na^n = 0\). This equation is exactly a polynomial over \(F\) that \(a\) satisfies, proving \(a\) is algebraic.
                </p>

                <div class="proof">

                        Suppose that \(E\) is a finite extension of \(F\) with dimension \([E:F] = n\), and \(a \in E\). 
                        Consider the set of \(n+1\) elements: \(\{1, a, \ldots, a^n\}\). Since  \(E\) is an \(n\)-dimensional 
                        vector space over \(F\), any set of more than \(n\) elements must be linearly dependent. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thus, there exist elements \(c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n \in F\) (not all zero) such that 
                        \[
                        c_n a^n + c_{n-1} a^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 a + c_0 = 0.
                        \]
                        Clearly, then, \(a\) is a root of the nonzero polynomial 
                        \[
                        f(x) = c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 x + c_0.
                        \]
                        Therefore, by definition, \(a\) is algebraic over \(F\). Since this applies to any \(a \in E\), the 
                        entire extension \(E\) is algebraic.

                    When building complex architectures - such as stacking layers in a deep neural network or composing transformations in a robotic arm - 
                    we need to know how the total dimensionality behaves. In field theory, we stack extensions. The <strong>Tower Rule</strong> tells us exactly

                        If \(K\) is a finite extension of the field \(E\), and \(E\) is a finite extension of the field \(F\), then

                        Let \(X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}\) be a basis for \(K\) over \(E\), and 
                        Let \(Y = \{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_m\}\) be a basis for \(E\) over \(F\). 
                        We claim that the set 
                        \[
                        YX = \{y_j x_i \mid 1 \leq j \leq m, \, 1 \leq i \leq n\}
                        \]
                        forms a basis for \(K\) over \(F\). To prove this,  we must show that \(YX\) spans \(K\) over \(F\), and that 
                        \(YX\) is linearly independent over \(F\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, let \(a \in K\). Then there are elements \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \in E\) such that
                        \[
                        a = b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + \cdots + b_n x_n.
                        \]
                        and for each \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, n\), there are elements \(c_{i1}, c_{i2}, \ldots, c_{im} \in F\) 
                        such that 
                        \[
                        b_i = c_{i1} y_{1} + c_{i2} y_2 + \cdots + c_{im} y_{m}.
                        \]
                        Thus, 
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        a &= \sum_{i=1}^n b_i x_i \\\\
                          &= \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\sum_{j=1}^m c_{ij} y_j \right) x_i \\\\
                          &= \sum_{i, j} c_{ij} (y_j x_i).
                        \end{align*}
                        \]
                        Thus, \(YX\) spans \(K\) over \(F\).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, suppose there are elements \(c_{ij} \in F\) such that 
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        0 &= \sum_{i, j} c_{ij} (y_j x_i) \\\\
                          &= \sum_i \left(\sum_j (c_{ij} y_j)\right) x_i.
                        \end{align*}
                        \]
                        Then, since each \(\sum_j c_{ij} y_j \in E\) and \(X\) is a basis for \(K\) over \(E\), for each \(i\), we have 
                        \[
                        \sum_j c_{ij} y_j = 0.
                        \]
                        However, each \(c_{ij} \in F\) and \(Y\) is a basis for \(E\) over \(F\), so each \(c_{ij} = 0\). Therefore, 
                        the set \(YX\) is linearly independent over \(F\).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since \(YX\) is a basis for \(K\) over \(F\) containing exactly \(mn\) distinct elements, we conclude that 
                        \[
                        [K:F] = mn = [K:E][E:F].
                        \]

                    If we extend a field with multiple algebraic elements, say \(F(a, b)\), do we really need to track both independent dimensions? 
                    In many cases, no. The <strong>Primitive Element Theorem</strong> acts as a form of algebraic dimensionality reduction, proving

                            <strong>Compression via a "Primitive Element":</strong><br>
                            Surprisingly, we do not need to keep track of two separate generators. We can define a single, combined element 
                            \(c = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\). This single element is sufficient to generate the entire field: 
                            \[
                            \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}).
                            \]
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Decoding the Information:</strong><br>
                            We can see this as a "lossless" encoding by showing that the original generators can be recovered entirely through polynomial operations 
                            on \(c\). Let's calculate the cube of \(c\):
                            \[
                            \begin{align*}
                            c^3 &= (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^3 = (\sqrt{2})^3 + 3(\sqrt{2})^2\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{3})^2 + (\sqrt{3})^3 \\\\
                                &= 2\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{3} + 9\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{3}  \\\\\
                                &= 11\sqrt{2} + 9\sqrt{3}
                            \end{align*}
                            Now, if we subtract \(9c\) from \(c^3\), the \(\sqrt{3}\) terms beautifully cancel out:
                            \[
                            c^3 - 9c = (11\sqrt{2} + 9\sqrt{3}) - 9(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) = 2\sqrt{2}
                            \]
                            Therefore, we can perfectly decode \(\sqrt{2}\) using the formula \(\sqrt{2} = \frac{1}{2}(c^3 - 9c)\). 
                            Once we have \(\sqrt{2}\), we easily get \(\sqrt{3} = c - \sqrt{2}\).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The CS Perspective:</strong><br>
                        This is perfectly analogous to <strong>lossless data packing</strong> or hashing. Instead of maintaining two separate 
                        variables (or allocating two separate memory addresses for \(\sqrt{2}\) and \(\sqrt{3}\)), we can apply a specific 
                        weighting to sum them into a single variable (\(c\)) without any loss of structural information. The Primitive Element 
                        Theorem guarantees that such a lossless flattening is always possible for finite extensions (in characteristic 0).

                <h2>Properties of Algebraic Extensions</h2>
               
                <p>
                    In algorithm design and mathematical modeling, <strong>closure</strong> is a critical property. It ensures that an operation 
                    applied to valid inputs always produces a valid output. Before we can transition to studying smooth manifolds and continuous 
                    groups, we must guarantee that our algebraic building blocks are perfectly stable.

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Subfield of Algebraic Elements</span>
                     <p>
                        Let \(E\) be an extension field of the field of \(F\). Then the set of all elements in \(E\) that are 
                        algebraic over \(F\) is a subfield of \(E\).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This means that if you take two algebraic numbers and add, subtract, multiply, or divide them, the result is 
                    guaranteed to also be an algebraic number. Finally, this closure applies not just to elements within a single extension, but 
                    to the extensions themselves.

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>

                    <p>
                        Suppose that \(a, b \in E\) are algebraic over \(F\) and \(b \neq 0\). To show they form a subfield, we must show that all
                        \(a+b\), \(a-b\), \(ab\) and \(a/b\) are algebraic over \(F\). To do this, it suffices to show that the extension degree 
                        \([F(a, b):F]\) is finite, because each of these four elements is contained within \(F(a, b)\). 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since \(b\) is algebraic over \(F\), the simple extension \(F(b)\) has a finite degree over \(F\). Also, since \(a\) is 
                        algebraic over \(F\), it is certainly algebraic over \(F(b)\). Thus, the extension \(F(a,b)\) over \(F(b)\) is also finite. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here, by the <strong>Tower Rule</strong>, we know that 
                        \[
                        [F(a, b):F] = [F(a, b):F(b)][F(b):F].
                        \]
                        Since both terms on the right are finite, \([F(a,b) : F]\) is finite. Because <strong>Finite Implies Algebraic</strong>, 
                        every element inside \(F(a,b)\) must be algebraic over \(F\). 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since field operations are closed, \(a+b\), \(a-b\), \(ab\), and \(a/b\) are all in \(F(a,b)\). Therefore, they are all 
                        guaranteed to be algebraic over \(F\). The algebraic elements form a subfield of \(E\).
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Algebraic over ALgebraic is Algebraic</span>
                     <p>
                        If \(K\) is an algebraic extension of \(E\), and \(E\) is an algebraic extension of \(F\), then 
                        \(K\) is an algebraic extension of \(F\).

                <p>
                    These theorems prove that the "algebraic universe" is closed. We can stack finite extensions on top of each other safely without 
                    accidentally falling into infinite-dimensional (transcendental) chaos. With this secure, discrete foundation of dimensions and 
                    extensions established, we are now ready to transition to continuous geometry, starting with the discrete symmetries of polygons 
                    and evolving into the continuous Lie Groups of 3D space: \(SO(3)\) and \(SE(3)\).
