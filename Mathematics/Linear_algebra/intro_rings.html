                <p>
                    In the previous pages, we developed the theory of groups — algebraic structures with a single 
                    binary operation satisfying closure, associativity, identity, and inverse properties. Groups 
                    capture symmetry and have wide applications from cryptography to physics. However, when we 
                    consider our most familiar number systems — the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\), the rationals 
                    \(\mathbb{Q}\), or the reals \(\mathbb{R}\) — we notice that they come equipped with 
                    <strong>two</strong> operations: addition and multiplication. A group structure alone cannot 
                    capture this richer algebraic behavior. This observation motivates the study of <strong>rings</strong>: 
                    algebraic structures that combine an Abelian group under addition with a <strong>second operation (multiplication)</strong> 
                    that interacts with addition through the distributive laws. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the context of computer science, ring theory is directly relevant to several applications:
                </p>

                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Modular arithmetic</strong>: The ring \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) underlies cryptographic 
                        systems like RSA, hash functions, and pseudorandom number generators. Understanding when 
                        \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) has zero divisors (when \(n\) is composite) versus when it is a field 
                        (when \(n\) is prime) is essential for cryptographic security.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Error-correcting codes</strong>: Cyclic redundancy checks (CRC), Reed-Solomon 
                        codes, and BCH codes are all built on polynomial rings over finite fields. The algebraic 
                        structure enables efficient encoding and decoding algorithms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Computer algebra systems</strong>: Software like Mathematica, Maple, and SageMath 
                        implement algorithms for polynomial factorization, GCD computation, and solving systems 
                        of polynomial equations — all of which rely on ring-theoretic foundations.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Ring</span>
                    A <strong>ring</strong> \(R\) is a set with two binary operations, addition(\(a + b\)) and multiplication(\(ab\)), 
                    such that for all \(a, b, c\) in \(R\):

                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li><strong>Commutativity of addition:</strong> \(a + b = b + a\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Associativity of addition:</strong> \((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Additive identity:</strong> There exists an element \(0 \in R\) such that \(a + 0 = a\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Additive inverses:</strong> There exists an element \(-a \in R\) such that \(a + (-a) = 0\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Associativity of multiplication:</strong> \(a(bc) = (ab)c\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Distributive laws:</strong> \(a(b + c) = ab + ac\) and \((b + c)a = ba + ca\).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Thus, a ring is an <strong>Abelian group under addition </strong>, coupled with an associative multiplication that is 
                    left and right distributive over addition. Note that <strong>multiplication need not be commutative</strong>. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Furthermore, a multiplicative identity is NOT required by the general definition. If a ring 
                    possesses a multiplicative identity \(1\) such that \(1a = a1 = a\) for all \(a \in R\),  we call the ring a 
                    ring with <strong>unity</strong>. (This unity is unique.) It is important to note that the existence of a 
                    multiplicative identity is independent of commutativity. A ring can have a unity without being commutative.
                    For example, in the ring \(M_2(\mathbb{Z})\), the identity matrix \(I_2\) exists, but \(AB \neq BA\) for 
                    most matrices \(A, B \in M_2(\mathbb{Z})\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even in a commutative ring with unity, a nonzero element <strong>is not required</strong> 
                    to have a multiplicative inverse. An element \(a\) that possesses an inverse \(a^{-1}\) 
                    (satisfying \(aa^{-1} = a^{-1}a = 1\)) is called a <strong>unit</strong>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This multiplicative inverse is unique. The set of all units in a ring \(R\) forms a 
                    group under multiplication, denoted by \(U(R)\) or \(R^\times\). Note that in many 
                    rings, such as \(\mathbb{Z}\), most elements fail to be units.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let \(R\) be a commutative ring, and let \(a, b \in R\) with \(a\) is nonzero. We say that 
                    \(a\) <strong>divides</strong> \(b\) written \(a \mid b\), if there exists \(c \in R\) such that \(b = ac\). If 
                    no such \(c\) exists, we write \(a \nmid b\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    With these definitions in hand, we can now classify \(\mathbb{Z}\): the integers under ordinary addition and 
                    multiplication form a <strong>commutative ring with unity 1</strong>, where the only units are \(1\) and \(-1\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    By contrast, as we know, matrix multiplication is not commutative. The set 
                    \(M_2(\mathbb{Z})\) of \(2 \times 2\) matrices with integer entries forms a noncommutative ring with unity
                    \[
                    I_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}.
                    \]
                    Moreover, the units of \(M_2(\mathbb{Z})\) are the matrices \(A\) such that \(\det A = \pm 1\). 
                    In general, the group of units of \(M_n(\mathbb{Z})\) is denoted \(GL_n(\mathbb{Z})\) and is called the 
                    <strong>general linear group over \(\mathbb{Z}\)</strong>.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Units of \(M_n(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>
                    A matrix \(A \in M_n(\mathbb{Z})\) is a unit if and only if \(\det A = \pm 1\).

                        First, suppose \(\det A = \pm 1\). we know that \(A^{-1}\) exists 
                        and is given by 
                        \[
                        A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A} \operatorname{adj}(A),
                        \]
                        where \(\operatorname{adj}(A)\) is the 
                        <a href="determinants.html#inv"><strong>adjugate matrix</strong></a> (the transpose of the cofactor matrix). 
                        Since \(A\) has integer entries, each cofactor is an integer, so \(\operatorname{adj}(A) \in M_n(\mathbb{Z})\). 
                        Because \(\det A = \pm 1\), we have \(\frac{1}{\det A} = \pm 1 \in \mathbb{Z}\), and thus 
                        \(A^{-1} \in M_n(\mathbb{Z})\). Therefore, \(A\) is a unit in \(M_n(\mathbb{Z})\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, suppose \(A\) is a unit in \(M_n(\mathbb{Z})\), so there exists \(B \in M_n(\mathbb{Z})\) 
                        with \(AB = I_n\). Taking determinants of both sides:
                        \[
                        \det(AB) = \det(I_n) \implies (\det A)(\det B) = 1.
                        \]
                        Since \(\det A\) and \(\det B\) are both integers and their product is \(1\), the only possibilities 
                        are \(\det A = \det B = 1\) or \(\det A = \det B = -1\). In either case, \(\det A = \pm 1\).

                        First, if \(S\) is a subring, it is closed under subtraction and multiplication 
                        by definition of a ring.

                        Next, suppose \(S \neq \emptyset\) is closed under subtraction and multiplication.

                        <strong>Additive structure (Abelian group):</strong> Since \(S \neq \emptyset\), there exists

                        identity. For any \(a \in S\), we have \(0 - a = -a \in S\), establishing additive inverses. For any 
                        \(a, b \in S\), since \(-b \in S\), we have \(a - (-b) = a + b \in S\), establishing closure

                    The elegance of this test lies in how closure under subtraction encapsulates three requirements 
                    simultaneously: existence of the additive identity (via \(a - a = 0\)), existence of additive 
                    inverses (via \(0 - a = -a\)), and closure under addition (via \(a - (-b) = a + b\)). 
                    Recall from the definition that a ring is an Abelian group under addition. Thus, the Subring 
                    Test consists of two parts: the One-Step Subgroup Test for the additive structure, and 
                    closure under multiplication.
