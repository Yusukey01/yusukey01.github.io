                <h2>Rings</h2>

                <p>
                    In the previous pages, we developed the theory of groups — algebraic structures with a single 
                    binary operation satisfying closure, associativity, identity, and inverse properties. Groups 
                    capture symmetry and have wide applications from cryptography to physics. However, when we 
                    consider our most familiar number systems — the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\), the rationals 
                    \(\mathbb{Q}\), or the reals \(\mathbb{R}\) — we notice that they come equipped with 
                    <strong>two</strong> operations: addition and multiplication. A group structure alone cannot 
                    capture this richer algebraic behavior. This observation motivates the study of <strong>rings</strong>: 
                    algebraic structures that combine an Abelian group under addition with a <strong>second operation (multiplication)</strong> 
                    that interacts with addition through the distributive laws. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the context of computer science, ring theory is directly relevant to several applications:
                </p>

                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Modular arithmetic</strong>: The ring \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) underlies cryptographic 
                        systems like RSA, hash functions, and pseudorandom number generators. Understanding when 
                        \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) has zero divisors (when \(n\) is composite) versus when it is a field 
                        (when \(n\) is prime) is essential for cryptographic security.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Error-correcting codes</strong>: Cyclic redundancy checks (CRC), Reed-Solomon 
                        codes, and BCH codes are all built on polynomial rings over finite fields. The algebraic 
                        structure enables efficient encoding and decoding algorithms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Computer algebra systems</strong>: Software like Mathematica, Maple, and SageMath 
                        implement algorithms for polynomial factorization, GCD computation, and solving systems 
                        of polynomial equations — all of which rely on ring-theoretic foundations.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Ring</span>
                    A <strong>ring</strong> \(R\) is a set with two binary operations, addition(\(a + b\)) and multiplication(\(ab\)), 
                    such that for all \(a, b, c\) in \(R\):

                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li><strong>Commutativity of addition:</strong> \(a + b = b + a\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Associativity of addition:</strong> \((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Additive identity:</strong> There exists an element \(0 \in R\) such that \(a + 0 = a\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Additive inverses:</strong> There exists an element \(-a \in R\) such that \(a + (-a) = 0\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Associativity of multiplication:</strong> \(a(bc) = (ab)c\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Distributive laws:</strong> \(a(b + c) = ab + ac\) and \((b + c)a = ba + ca\).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Thus, a ring is an <a href="intro_groups.html#Abelian"><strong>Abelian group under addition</strong></a>, coupled 
                    with an associative multiplication that is left and right distributive over addition. Note that <strong>multiplication 
                    need not be commutative</strong>. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Furthermore, a multiplicative identity is not required by the general definition. If a ring 
                    possesses a multiplicative identity \(1\) such that \(1a = a1 = a\) for all \(a \in R\),  we call the ring a 
                    ring with <strong>unity</strong>. (This unity is unique.) It is important to note that the existence of a 
                    multiplicative identity is independent of commutativity. A ring can have a unity without being commutative.
                    For example, in the ring \(M_2(\mathbb{Z})\), the identity matrix \(I_2\) exists, but \(AB \neq BA\) for 
                    most matrices \(A, B \in M_2(\mathbb{Z})\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even in a commutative ring with unity, a nonzero element <strong>is not required</strong> 
                    to have a multiplicative inverse. An element \(a\) that possesses an inverse \(a^{-1}\) 
                    (satisfying \(aa^{-1} = a^{-1}a = 1\)) is called a <strong>unit</strong>. 
                    This multiplicative inverse is unique. Note that in many rings, such as \(\mathbb{Z}\), 
                    most elements fail to be units.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While <strong>units</strong> allow us to perform division-like operations via multiplicative 
                    inverses, we often need to describe the relationship between elements even when an inverse 
                    does not exist. This leads us to the concept of <strong>divisibility</strong> in a ring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let \(R\) be a commutative ring, and let \(a, b \in R\) where \(a \neq 0\). We say that 
                    \(a\) <strong>divides</strong> \(b\) (written \(a \mid b\)) if there exists an element 
                    \(c \in R\) such that \(b = ac\). If no such \(c\) exists, we write \(a \nmid b\).
                </p>

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Side Note:</span>
                    <p>
                        Previously, we defined the <a href="intro_groups.html#modulo"><strong>group of units modulo \(n\)</strong></a>, 
                        denoted as \(U(n)\), as the set of integers:
                        \[
                        \{a \in \mathbb{Z} \mid 0 < a < n, \gcd(a, n) = 1\}. 
                        \]
                        In the language of ring theory, this is exactly the group of <strong>units</strong> of the ring 
                        \(\mathbb{Z}_n\). That is:
                        \[ 
                        U(\mathbb{Z}_n) = U(n).
                        \]
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Let's observe some simple examples for rings. 
                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>\(\mathbb{Z}\): the set of integers under ordinary addition and multiplication forms
                        a <strong>commutative ring</strong> with unity 1.<br>
                         Note that the only units are \(1\) and \(-1\): (\(U(\mathbb{Z}) = \{-1, 1\}\).)</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    By contrast, as we know, matrix multiplication is not commutative. Thus,
                     <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>\(M_2(\mathbb{Z})\): the set of \(2 \times 2\) matrices with integer entries forms a <strong>noncommutative ring</strong> with unity
                        \[
                        I_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}.
                        \]</li>
                     </ul><br>
                    Moreover, the units of \(M_2(\mathbb{Z})\) are the matrices \(A\) such that \(\det A = \pm 1\). 
                    In general, the group of units of \(M_n(\mathbb{Z})\) is denoted:
                    \[
                     U(\(M_n(\mathbb{Z})\)) = GL(n, \mathbb{Z})
                    \] 
                    and is called the <strong>general linear group with degree \(n\) over \(\mathbb{Z}\)</strong>.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Units of \(M_n(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>
                    A matrix \(A \in M_n(\mathbb{Z})\) is a unit if and only if \(\det A = \pm 1\).
                </div>

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                    <p> 
                        First, suppose \(\det A = \pm 1\). we know that \(A^{-1}\) exists 
                        and is given by 
                        \[
                        A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A} \operatorname{adj}(A),
                        \]
                        where \(\operatorname{adj}(A)\) is the 
                        <a href="determinants.html#inv"><strong>adjugate matrix</strong></a> (the transpose of the cofactor matrix). 
                        Since \(A\) has integer entries, each cofactor is an integer, so \(\operatorname{adj}(A) \in M_n(\mathbb{Z})\). 
                        Because \(\det A = \pm 1\), we have \(\frac{1}{\det A} = \pm 1 \in \mathbb{Z}\), and thus 
                        \(A^{-1} \in M_n(\mathbb{Z})\). Therefore, \(A\) is a unit in \(M_n(\mathbb{Z})\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, suppose \(A\) is a unit in \(M_n(\mathbb{Z})\), so there exists \(B \in M_n(\mathbb{Z})\) 
                        with \(AB = I_n\). Taking determinants of both sides:
                        \[
                        \det(AB) = \det(I_n) \implies (\det A)(\det B) = 1.
                        \]
                        Since \(\det A\) and \(\det B\) are both integers and their product is \(1\), the only possibilities 
                        are \(\det A = \det B = 1\) or \(\det A = \det B = -1\). In either case, \(\det A = \pm 1\).
                    </p>

                    A nonempty subset \(S\) of a ring \(R\) is a subring if and only if \(S\) is closed under 
                    subtraction and multiplication, that is, 
                    \[
                    \forall a, b \in S, \quad (a - b) \in S \text{ and } ab \in S.

                    <p>
                        First, if \(S\) is a subring, it is closed under subtraction and multiplication 
                        by definition of a ring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, suppose \(S \neq \emptyset\) is closed under subtraction and multiplication. 
                        We must verify all ring axioms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Additive structure (Abelian group):</strong> Since \(S \neq \emptyset\), there exists 
                        some \(a \in S\). By closure under subtraction, \(a - a = 0 \in S\), establishing the additive 
                        identity. For any \(a \in S\), we have \(0 - a = -a \in S\), establishing additive inverses. For any 
                        \(a, b \in S\), since \(-b \in S\), we have \(a - (-b) = a + b \in S\), establishing closure 
                        under addition. Associativity and commutativity of addition are inherited from \(R\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Multiplicative structure:</strong> Closure under multiplication is given by hypothesis, 
                        and associativity of multiplication is inherited from \(R\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Distributivity:</strong> The distributive laws are inherited from \(R\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, \(S\) is a subring of \(R\).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The elegance of this test lies in how closure under subtraction encapsulates three requirements 
                    simultaneously: existence of the additive identity (via \(a - a = 0\)), existence of additive 
                    inverses (via \(0 - a = -a\)), and closure under addition (via \(a - (-b) = a + b\)). 
                    Recall from the definition that a ring is an Abelian group under addition. Thus, the Subring 
                    Test consists of two parts: the <a href="intro_groups.html#sub"><strong>One-Step Subgroup Test</strong></a> 
                    for the additive structure, and closure under multiplication.

                        First, we recognize that the rational numbers <strong>\(\mathbb{Q}\) form a commutative ring with unity (1\)</strong>

                    <br>
                    You may notice a slight variation in how textbooks define a "subring." This depends on the overarching 
                    definition of a "ring":

                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Approach A (Ring with Unity):</strong> If we define all rings to must have a unity (\(1\)), then a 
                        subring <strong>must</strong> contain the same \(1\) as the parent ring. In this case, the set of all even 
                        numbers \(2\mathbb{Z}\) is not a subring of \(\mathbb{Z}\).

                        <strong>Approach B (General Ring):</strong> If we allow rings to exist without a unity, then a subring only 
                        needs to be closed under subtraction and multiplication. Under this definition, \(2\mathbb{Z}\) <strong>is</strong> 
                        a subring of \(\mathbb{Z}\).

                <p>
                    In the hierarchy of algebraic structures, <strong>integral domains</strong> represent a crucial step 
                    between general rings and fields, designed to capture the reliable arithmetic properties of the integers.

                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Zero-Divisors</span>
                    A <strong>zero-divisor</strong> is a nonzero element \(a\) of a commutative ring \(R\) such that 
                    there exists a nonzero element \(b \in R\) with \(ab = 0\).

                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Integral Domain</span>
                    An <strong>integral domain</strong> is a commutative ring with unity and <strong>no zero-divisors</strong>.
                </div>

                <p>
                    The standard ring of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) is the prototypical integral domain. 
                    In contrast, the matrix ring \(M_2 (\mathbb{Z})\) is not an integral domain because it contains zero-divisors. 
                    Two non-zero matrices can multiply to produce the zero matrix:
                    \[
                    \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} 
                    = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
                    \]
                </p>

                <p>
                    The absence of zero-divisors grants integral domains a powerful property that general rings lack: 
                    the ability to cancel common factors.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: Cancellation Law</span>

                    then \(b = c\).
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Proof Insight:</em> Since \(ab - ac = a(b - c) = 0\) and \(a \neq 0\), the absence of zero-divisors guarantees \(b - c = 0\).

                <p>
                    This theorem reveals the primary motivation behind the definition: mathematicians wanted to isolate the core properties 
                    that make \(\mathbb{Z}\) so reliable. By excluding "zero-divisors," integral domains ensure that multiplication 
                    never results in an irreversible loss of information. This structure provides the necessary foundation for algebra 
                    before moving toward even more restricted systems, such as <strong>Fields</strong>, where division is fully defined.

                <p>
                    We now arrive at the most strictly defined algebraic structure in this hierarchy. 
                    While integral domains ensure that cancellation is valid, <strong>fields</strong> go one step further 
                    by guaranteeing that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse(i.e., unit). 
                    This creates a system where division is fully defined for all nonzero elements.

                    In structural terms, this definition implies a high degree of symmetry. 
                    A field \(F\) is a set where \((F, +)\) forms an abelian group (addition), and the nonzero elements 
                    \((F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)\) also form an abelian group (multiplication). 
                    The two operations are connected via the distributive law.

                    The most familiar examples of fields are the number systems we use in calculus and analysis.

                        Includes all fractions \(p/q\) where \(q \neq 0\). If \(a \in \mathbb{Q}\) is nonzero, its inverse \(1/a\) is also in \(\mathbb{Q}\).

                    <li><strong>The Complex Numbers (\(\mathbb{C}\)):</strong> 
                        Even though \(\mathbb{C}\) contains "imaginary" numbers, it is a field because every nonzero complex number \(a + bi\) has an inverse \(\frac{a - bi}{a^2 + b^2}\) within the set.

                <p>
                    Note that the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) do <strong>not</strong> form a field. While \(\mathbb{Z}\) is an integral 
                    domain (no zero-divisors), the only elements with multiplicative inverses are \(1\) and \(-1\). For instance, 
                    \(2 \in \mathbb{Z}\), but its inverse \(1/2 \notin \mathbb{Z}\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    A natural question arises: do we always need to check for multiplicative inverses explicitly? 
                    For infinite rings like \(\mathbb{Z}\), we know that the absence of zero-divisors does not guarantee 
                    the existence of inverses. However, when the ring is <strong>finite</strong>, the situation changes 
                    dramatically. Finiteness prevents elements from "escaping" to infinity without cycling back, forcing 
                    the structure to be more rigid.

                        Let \(D\) be a finite integral domain with unity \(1\). To show that \(D\) is a field, we must show 
                        that every nonzero element \(a \in D\) has a multiplicative inverse (i.e., unit).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                         If \(a = 1\), it is its own inverse, so we assume that \(a \neq 1\).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Consider the sequence of powers of \(a \in D\):
                        \[ 
                        a, a^2, a^3, a^4, \dots 
                        \]
                        since \(D\) is a <strong>finite set</strong>, the sequence cannot continue to produce new values forever. 
                        <br>
                        Thus, there must be two positive integers \(i\) and \(j\) such that:
                        \[
                        i > j \text{ and } a^i = a^j.
                        \] 
                        <br>
                        (This equality tells us that after a certain number of steps, the sequence has returned to a previously visited state.)

                    <p>
                        We can rewrite this as:

                        a^j(a^{i-j} -1) &= 0 \\\\
                        a^{i-j} &= 1  \quad (\text{By cancellation}).
                        \end{align*}

                        Since \(a \neq 1\), \(i - j > 1\), and this result shows that the loop always cycles back to the unity \(1\).
                        <br>
                        We then factor out one \(a\):
                        \[
                        a \cdot a^{i-j-1} = 1 
                        \]
                        Therefore, \(a^{i-j-1}\) is the inverse of \(a\).

                        The set \(\mathbb{Z}_p = \{0, 1, \dots, p-1\}\) contains exactly \(p\) elements. Since \(p\) is a fixed prime, 
                        the ring \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) of integers modulo a prime \(p\) is <strong>finite</strong>.  
                        Now we must show that \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) has no zero-divisors. 
                        Suppose that \(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_p\) and \(ab = 0\). 
                        This implies that \(ab = pk\) for some integer \(k\).
                        By Euclid's Lemma, since the prime \(p\) divides the product \(ab\), it must divide \(a\) or \(p\) must divide \(b\).

                    Because we found a unique inverse for every non-zero element, \(\mathbb{Z}_5\) behaves as a field. 
                    In a computer program, this means we can perform "division" by \(3\) simply by 
                    multiplying by \(2\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a standard program, dividing \(4\) by \(3\) would result in a floating-point number (\(1.333...\)), introducing potential rounding errors. 
                    However, in the field \(\mathbb{Z}_5\), "dividing by \(3\)" is equivalent to "multiplying by the inverse of \(3\)," which is \(2\). 
                    Thus, we calculate:
                    \[ 
                    4 \div 3 \equiv 4 \cdot 3^{-1} \equiv 4 \cdot 2 = 8 \equiv 3 \pmod 5 
                    \]
                    This allows algorithms to remain purely integer-based and 100% precise, which is the fundamental reason why finite fields are used in 
                    cryptography and error-correction codes.

                <h2>Characteristic of a Ring</h2>

                <p>
                    We have seen that in standard number systems like \(\mathbb{Z}\) or \(\mathbb{R}\), adding the unity element \(1\) 
                    to itself repeatedly (\(1 + 1 + 1 + \dots\)) never results in zero. However, in modular arithmetic rings 
                    like \(\mathbb{Z}_n\), repeated addition eventually cycles back to zero (e.g., in \(\mathbb{Z}_5\), \(1+1+1+1+1 = 5 \equiv 0\)).
                </p>

                <p>
                    This distinction — whether a ring behaves like "integers" (infinite growth) or "clock arithmetic" (cyclic)
                    — is captured by the concept of the <strong>characteristic</strong>.

                    The characteristic of a ring \(R\) is the least positive integer \(n\) such that 
                    \[
                    \forall x \in R, \, n \cdot x = 0.

                    If no such integer exists, we say that \(R\) has characteristic \(0\). The characteristic 
                    of \(R\) is denoted by \(\text{char } R\).

                        By definition, if \(1\) has infinite order, there is no positive integer \(n\) such that \(n \cdot 1 = 0\). 
                        Since the characteristic is defined as the least such positive integer \(n\) that satisfies \(n \cdot x = 0\) for all \(x\), 
                        and no such \(n\) exists even for the element \(1\), it follows that \(\text{char } R = 0\).

                        Suppose \(1\) has additive order \(n\). Then \(n\) is the least positive integer such that \(n \cdot 1 = 0\). 
                        For any arbitrary element \(x \in R\), we have
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        n \cdot x &= \underbrace{x + x + \cdots + x}_{n \text{ times}} \\\\
                                &= \underbrace{(1 \cdot x) + (1 \cdot x) + \cdots + (1 \cdot x)}_{n \text{ times}} \\\\

                                &= 0 \cdot x \\\\
                                &= 0.
                        \end{align*}
                        \]
                        This demonstrates that \(n \cdot x = 0\) for all \(x \in R\). Since \(n\) is the smallest integer that satisfies this for \(x = 1\), 
                        it must be the least positive integer that satisfies it for all \(x\). Thus, \(\text{char } R = n\).

                        Let \(D\) be an integral domain with unity \(1\). If the additive order of \(1\) is infinite, 
                        then \(\text{char } D = 0\) by definition.

                        Now, suppose \(\text{char } D = n\), where \(n > 0\). Since an integral domain must contain at least 
                        two distinct elements (\(0 \neq 1\)), we have \(n \cdot 1 = 0\) where \(n > 1\). 
                        We will prove that \(n\) must be prime by contradiction.
                    </p>

                   <p>
                        Assume \(n\) is composite such that \(n = st\), where \(s\) and \(t\) are integers such that \(1 < s < n\) and \(1 < t < n\). 
                        Recall the property of scalar multiplication in rings: \((s \cdot a)(t \cdot b) = (st) \cdot (ab)\) for any \(a, b \in D\). 
                        By setting both \(a\) and \(b\) to the unity element \(1\), we can evaluate the product:
                        \[
                        0 = n \cdot 1 = (st) \cdot 1 = (s \cdot 1)(t \cdot 1).
                        \]
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since \(D\) is an integral domain, it has no zero-divisors. Therefore, the equation 
                        \((s \cdot 1)(t \cdot 1) = 0\) implies that:
                        \[
                        s \cdot 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad t \cdot 1 = 0.
                        \]
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, this contradicts the definition of the characteristic \(n\) as the least positive integer such that 
                        \(n \cdot 1 = 0\). Since  both \(s\) and \(t\) are strictly less than \(n\), neither \( s \cdot 1 \) nor \(t \cdot 1\) 
                        can be zero. Therefore, \(n\) cannot be composite and must be prime.

                    In digital systems, fields of <strong>characteristic 2</strong> (such as \(GF(2^n)\)) are important. 
                    They are the backbone of modern technologies like <strong>AES encryption</strong>, <strong>QR code error correction</strong>, 
                    and <strong>RAID-6 storage</strong>. The reason lies in how perfectly their arithmetic aligns with "binary" logic.

                <p>
                    In a field of characteristic 2, the definition \(1 + 1 = 0\) leads to a unique property. For any element \(a\) in the field:
                    \[ 
                    a + a = a(1 + 1) = a \cdot 0 = 0 
                    \]
                    Since \(a + a = 0\), the additive inverse of \(a\) (the element you add to \(a\) to get \(0\)) is simply \(a\) itself. 
                    Mathematically, this means:
                    \[ 
                    a = -a.

                    as <code>A ^ B</code> in code. This allows cryptographic algorithms to run at extremely high speeds by replacing heavy arithmetic 
                    with simple bitwise logic.

                <h2>Perspective: Two Roads from a Field</h2>

                <p>
                    With the definitions of fields and characteristics in place, we have reached a major summit in algebra. 
                    From here, the landscape of mathematics diverges into two distinct paths based on the <strong>characteristic</strong> of the field.

                    While \(\mathbb{Q}\) and \(\mathbb{R}\) both have characteristic 0, \(\mathbb{R}\) is unique because it is <strong>complete</strong> (no holes). 
                    This allows for the calculus we use in gradients and simulations. When algebraic operations are compatible with this "nearness," we call it a 
                    <strong>Topological Field</strong>.
