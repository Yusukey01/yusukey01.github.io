                <h2>From Groups to Rings</h2>
                
                <p>
                    In the previous pages, we developed the theory of groups — algebraic structures with a single 
                    binary operation satisfying closure, associativity, identity, and inverse properties. Groups 
                    capture symmetry and have wide applications from cryptography to physics. However, when we 
                    consider our most familiar number systems — the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\), the rationals 
                    \(\mathbb{Q}\), or the reals \(\mathbb{R}\) — we notice that they come equipped with 
                    <strong>two</strong> operations: addition and multiplication. A group structure alone cannot 
                    capture this richer algebraic behavior. This observation motivates the study of <strong>rings</strong>: 
                    algebraic structures that combine an Abelian group under addition with a <strong>second operation (multiplication)</strong> 
                    that interacts with addition through the distributive laws. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For CS people, ring theory is directly relevant to several applications:
                </p>

                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Modular arithmetic</strong>: The ring \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) underlies cryptographic 
                        systems like RSA, hash functions, and pseudorandom number generators. Understanding when 
                        \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) has zero divisors (when \(n\) is composite) versus when it is a field 
                        (when \(n\) is prime) is essential for cryptographic security.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Error-correcting codes</strong>: Cyclic redundancy checks (CRC), Reed-Solomon 
                        codes, and BCH codes are all built on polynomial rings over finite fields. The algebraic 
                        structure enables efficient encoding and decoding algorithms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Computer algebra systems</strong>: Software like Mathematica, Maple, and SageMath 
                        implement algorithms for polynomial factorization, GCD computation, and solving systems 
                        of polynomial equations — all of which rely on ring-theoretic foundations.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Ring</span>
                    A <strong>ring</strong> \(R\) is a set with two binary operations, addition(\(a + b\)) and multiplication(\(ab\)), 
                    such that for all \(a, b, c\) in \(R\):

                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li><strong>Commutativity of addition:</strong> \(a + b = b + a\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Associativity of addition:</strong> \((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Additive identity:</strong> There is an element \(0\) such that \(a + 0 = a\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Additive inverses:</strong> There is an element \(-a\) in \(R\) such that \(a + (-a) = 0\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Associativity of multiplication:</strong> \(a(bc) = (ab)c\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Distributive laws:</strong> \(a(b + c) = ab + ac\) and \((b + c)a = ba + ca\).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    So, a ring is an <strong>Abelian group</strong> under addition, also having an associative multiplication that is 
                    left and right distributive over addition, but multiplication does not have to be commutative. Notice that an identity 
                    under multiplication is not required. If a ring has such a nonzero element, we call it a <strong>unity</strong>. Moreover, 
                    a nonzero element of <strong>commutative ring</strong> with unity need not have a multiplicative inverse (\(a^{-1}\)). 
                    When it does, it is called a <strong>unit</strong> of the ring. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, we can explain what the set of all integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) is. \(\mathbb{Z}\) under 
                    ordinary addition and multiplication is a <strong>commutative ring with unity</strong> \(1\), 
                    and the only units of \(\mathbb{Z}\) are \(1\) and \(-1\).
                </p>
