                <h2>The Ring of Polynomials</h2>
                <p>
                    In previous chapters, we have explored the abstract "shapes" of mathematical structures: groups, rings, and fields.  
                    To reach the realm of modern cryptography such as <strong>advanced encryption stadard (AES)</strong>, we must now confront a significant 
                    wall of abstraction.This transition requires a fundamental shift in perspective: treating polynomials not merely as functions 
                    of a variable \(x\), but as <strong>elements</strong> of a ring themselves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have been taught to treat polynomials as something into which we substitute numbers. But to mathematically govern the bitstreams handled by computers, 
                    we must treat polynomials like "numbers" in their own right, equipped with their own addition and multiplication. Just as we did when we first encountered 
                    the formal axioms of a metric, we must now dig out the rigorous algebraic properties hidden behind the obvious nature of polynomials. This abstraction is 
                    the most powerful "precision ruler" we have for decoding the complex algorithms that secure our digital world.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">

                    Let \(R\) be a commutative ring. The set of formal symbols
                    \[
                    R[x] = \{a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x_1 + a_0 \mid a_i \in R, \, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\}

                    of \(R[x]\) are said to be equivalent if and only if \(a_i = b_i\) fir all nonnegative integers \(i\). Note

                    Let \(R\) be a commutative ring and let

                    f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0

                    belong to \(R[x]\).  Then                
                    \[

                    <br>
                    Also,

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                    Since \(D[x]\) is a ring, we show that \(D[x]\) is commutative with a unity and has no zero-divisors. It is clear that 
                    \(D[x]\) is commutative.  
                    If \(1\) is the unity element of \(D\), it is obvious that \(f(x) = 1 \) is the unity element of \(D[x]\).
                    Here, suppose that
                    \[
                    f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0
                    \]
                    and
                    \[
                    g(x) = b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \cdots + b_1 x + b_0,
                    \]
                    where \(a_n \neq 0\) and \(b_m \neq 0\). Then, \(f(x)g(x)\) has leading coefficient \(a_n b_m\) and since 
                    \(D\) is an integral domain, \(a_nb_m \neq 0\).
