Resampling Techniques
Where to Insert:
Include as a sub-section within the new Statistical Inference & Hypothesis Testing section (or as a standalone mini-section right after it).
Rationale:
Methods like bootstrap and permutation tests are closely tied to inference, providing non-parametric ways to assess 
variability and significance.

Graphical Models
Where to Insert:
Place this as a new section between Part 13: Intro to Bayesian Statistics and Part 14: The Exponential Family.
Rationale:
Graphical models (e.g., Bayesian networks, Markov random fields) extend Bayesian ideas into structured, high-dimensional 
problems—a natural follow-up to your Bayesian introduction.

Monte Carlo Methods & Simulation
Where to Insert:
Introduce this topic as a new section between Part 16: Bayesian Decision Theory and Part 17: Markov Chains.
Rationale:
Monte Carlo techniques, including MCMC methods, are essential for simulation-based inference and complement decision 
theory before moving on to sequential models like Markov chains.

Nonparametric Methods
Where to Insert:
Add this as an optional or additional section after the new Statistical Inference & Hypothesis Testing material (or integrated 
within that section if you want a unified treatment of inference techniques).
Rationale:
Nonparametric approaches (e.g., kernel density estimation, rank-based tests) provide flexible alternatives 
when parametric assumptions do not hold, enriching your statistical toolkit.

Time Series Analysis
Where to Insert:
Place this as a final, standalone section right after Part 17: Markov Chains.
Rationale:
Time series analysis (including AR, MA, ARIMA models) builds on the idea of sequential dependencies introduced by Markov 
chains and addresses data with temporal structure, which is highly relevant for many ML applications.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC):
Add a dedicated sub-section or new part immediately following Part 17. This section would build on the Markov chains 
background to explain algorithms like Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings.
