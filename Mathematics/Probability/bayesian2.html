        <h1>The Exponential Family</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Actually, all members of the <strong>exponentil family</strong> have a conjugate prior. Before diving into Bayesian 
            statistics deeper, we discuss this important family of distributions. 
            <br><br>
            The exponential family is a family of probability distributions parameterized by 
            <strong>natural parameters</strong>(or <strong>canonical parameters</strong>) \(\eta \in \mathbb{R}^K\) with 
            support over \(\mathcal{X}^D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^D\) such that 
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            p(x | \eta ) &= \frac{1}{Z(\eta)} h(x) \exp\{\eta^T \mathcal{T}(x)\}\\\\
                         &= h(x) \exp\{\eta^T \mathcal{T}(x) - A(\eta)\}
            \end{align*}
            \]
            where 
            <ul>
                <li>\(h(x)\) is a <strong>base measure</strong>, which is a scaling constant, often 1.</li>
                <li>\(\mathcal{T}(x) \in \mathbb{R}^K\) is <strong>sufficient statistics</strong>.</li>
                <li>\(Z(\eta)\) is a normalization constant (or <strong>partition function</strong>) and \( A(\eta) = \log Z(\eta) \).</li>
            </ul>
            Each exponential family is defined by different \(h(x)\) and \(\mathcal{T}(x)\).
            <br>
            Note: the <strong>log partition function</strong> is convex over the convex set \(\Omega = \{\eta \in \mathbb{R}^K : A(\eta) < \infty\}\).
            <br><br>
            An exponential family is said to be <strong>minimal</strong> if there is no \(\eta \in \mathbb{R}^K \\ \{0\}\) such that 
            \[
            \eta^T\mathcal{T}(x) = 0.
            \]
            This means that the natural parameters are independent of each other. This condition can be violated in the case of multinomial distributions 
            but we can reparameterize the distribution using \(K-1\) independent parameters. 
            <br><br>
            Let \(\eta = f(\phi)\), where \(\phi\) is some other possibly smaller set of parameters, and then 
            \[
            p(x | \phi ) = h(x) \exp\{ f(\phi)^T \mathcal{T}(x) - A(f(\phi))\}.
            \]
            If the mapping \(\phi \to \eta\) is nonlinear, it is said to be a <strong>curved exponential family</strong>.
            <br>
            If \(\eta = f(\phi) = \phi\), the model is in <strong>canonical form</strong> and in addition, if \(\mathcal{T} =x\), 
            we call it a <strong>natural exponential family(NEF)</strong>: 
            \[
            p(x | \eta ) =  h(x) \exp\{\eta^T x - A(\eta)\}.
            \]
            Finally, we define the <strong>moment parameters</strong> as follows:
            \[
            m = \mathbb{E }[\mathcal{T}(x)] \in \mathbb{R}^K.
            \]
