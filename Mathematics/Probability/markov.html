        <h1>Language Model</h1>
        <blockquote>
            The <strong>Markov chain</strong> is a fundamental concept that appear in various fields. Although the core idea is 
            the same, the way they are used and studied can vary across disciplines. Let's see a specific application of the Markov chain.
            <br><br>
            Suppose our goal is  to generate a joint probability distribution over variable-length sequences: \(P(y_{1:T})\). 
            If \(y_t \in \{1, \cdots, K\}\) represents a <strong>word</strong> from a <strong>vocabulary</strong> with \(K\) possible 
            values, the resulting <strong>language model</strong> represents a distribution over possible sentences of length \(T\). 
            <br><br>
            By the chain rule of probability, 
            \[
            P(y_{1:T}) = P(y_1)P(y_2 | y_1)P(y_3 | y_2, y_1)\cdots = \prod_{t = 1}^{T} P(y_t | y_{t_1 : t-1}).
            \]
            This is too expensive as \(t\) grows. Intead, in <strong>Markov chain</strong>, we assume that the next state depends 
            solely on the current state:
            \[
            P(y_{1:T}) = P(y_1)P(y_2 | y_1)P(y_3 | y_2)P(y_4 | y_3)\cdots =  P(y_1)\prod_{t = 2}^{T} P(y_t | y_{t-1}).
            \]
            This <strong>memoryless property</strong> simplifies both the analysis and computation of probabilities.
            Here, the function \(p(y_t | y_{t-1})\) is called the <strong>transition function</strong>, or <strong>transition kernel</strong>. 
            It satisfies the conditions: 
            <ul>
                <li>\(P(y_t | y_{t-1}) \geq 0\)</li>
                <li>\(\sum_{k=1}^K P(y_t | y_{t-1} = j)  =1 \)</li>
            </ul>
            We can represent this as a <strong>stochastic matrix</strong>:
            \[
            A_{jk} = P(y_t = k | y_{t-1} = j)
            \]
            where each row sums to 1.
