        <blockquote>
            The concept of the <strong>Markov chain</strong> is fundamental in various fields. while the core idea remains 
            the same, its applications and methods of analysis can differ depending on the field. Here, we'll explore a specific application in 
            the context of <strong>language modeling</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Suppose our goal is to model a joint probability distribution over variable-length sequences: \(P(y_{1:T})\), where each 
            \(y_t \in \{1, \cdots, K\}\) represents a <strong>word</strong> from a <strong>vocabulary</strong> of size \(K\).
            A language model assigns probabilities to possible sentences (sequences) of length \(T\).
            <br><br>
            By the chain rule of probability, 
            \[
            P(y_{1:T}) = P(y_1)P(y_2 | y_1)P(y_3 | y_2, y_1)\cdots = \prod_{t = 1}^{T} P(y_t | y_{t_1 : t-1}).
            \]
            However, as \(T\) increases, this formulation becomes computationally expensive due to the need to condition on the 
            entire history. To address this, we make the <strong>Markov assumption</strong>: the next state depends only on the 
            current state.
            <br><br>
            Under the <strong>first-order Markov assumption</strong>,
            \[
            P(y_{1:T}) = P(y_1)P(y_2 | y_1)P(y_3 | y_2)P(y_4 | y_3)\cdots =  P(y_1)\prod_{t = 2}^{T} P(y_t | y_{t-1}).
            \]
            This <strong>memoryless property</strong> simplifies both analysis and computation of probabilities. 
            The function \(P(y_t | y_{t-1})\) is called the <strong>transition function</strong> or <strong>transition kernel</strong>, 
            and it satisfies:
            <ul>
                <li>\(P(y_t | y_{t-1}) \geq 0\)</li>
                <li>\(\sum_{k=1}^K P(y_t = k | y_{t-1} = j) = 1\) for each \(j\)</li>
            </ul>
            We can represent the transition probabilities using a
            <a href="../Linear_algebra/stochastic.html"><strong>stochastic matrix</strong></a>:
            \[
            A_{jk} = P(y_t = k | y_{t-1} = j),
            \]
            where each row of \(A\) sums to 1. This matrix is considered as the conditional probability Table (CPT). 
            Since we assume the same transition probabilities at all time steps, the model is said to be <strong>time-invariant</strong>. 
            <br><br>
            The Markov assumption can be extended to consider the last \(M\) states( or memory length):
            \[
            P(y_{1:T}) = P(y_{1 : M}) \prod_{t = M + 1}^T P(y_t | y_{t - M : t - 1}).
            \]
            This is known as an <strong>M'th order Markov model</strong>. In language modeling, this is equivalent to an \(M+1\)-gram model.
            For example, if \(M = 2\), 
            each word depends on the two preceding words, leading to a <strong>trigram model</strong>:
            \[
            P(y_t | y_{t-1}, y_{y-2}).
            \] 
            <br>
            Any Higher-order Markov model can be converted into the first-order Markov model by redefining the state to include the past \(M\) observations. 
            For \(M = 2\), define \(\tilde{y}_t = (y_{t-1}, y_t)\), then:
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            P(\tilde{y}_{1:T}) &= P(\tilde{y}_2) \prod_{t = 3}^T P(\tilde{y}_t | \tilde{y}_{t-1}) \\\\
                               &= P(y_1, y_2) \prod_{t = 3}^T P(y_t | y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}).
            \end{align*}
            \]
            <br>
            In practice, with large vocabularies, modeling all possible transitions becomes infeasible, and we need additional techniques such as 
            <strong>neural language models</strong> to approximate the distribution efficiently. Not only language modeling, <strong>Markov chains</strong> 
            are widely used in <strong>sequential data modeling</strong>. Additionally, <strong>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</strong> methods are crucial 
            in Bayesian statistics for performing approximate inference when direct sampling is challenging.

        <blockquote>
            The probability of any particular sequence of length T is given by 
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            P(x_{1:T} | \theta) &= \pi (x_1)A(x_1, x_2)\cdots A(x_{T-1}, x_T) \\\\
                                &= \prod_{j=1}^K (\pi_j)^{\mathbb{I}_{x_{1=j}}} \prod_{t=2}^T \prod_{j=1}^K \prod_{k=1}^K 
                                (A_{jk})^{\mathbb{I}_{x_t=k, x_{t-1}=j}}.
            \end{align*}
            \]
            Thus, the log-likelihood of a set of sequences \(\mathcal{D} = (x_1, \cdots, x_N)\), where 
            \(x_i = (x_{i\,1}, \cdots, x_{i \, T_{i}})\) is a sequence of length \(T_i\) is given by 
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            \log P(\mathcal{D} | \theta) &= \sum_{i=1}^N \log P(x_1 | \theta) \\\\
                                        &= \sum_j {N_j}^1 \log \pi_i + \sum_j \sum_k N_{jk} \log A_{jk}
            \end{align*}
            \]
            where we define the following counts: 
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            & {N_j}^1 = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}(x_{i1} = j)\\\\
            & N_{jk}  = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1} ^{T_i -1} \mathbb{I}(x_{i,t}  = j, x_{i, t+1} = k)\\\\
            & N_j = \sum_k N_{jk}.
            \end{align*}
            \]
            By adding Lagrange multipliers to enforce the sum to one constraints, the MLE is given by the 
            normalized counts:
            \[
            \hat{\pi_j} = \frac{{N_j}^1}{\sum_j` {N_j`}^1}, \quad \hat{A_{jk}} = \frac{N_{jk}}{N_j}
            \]
