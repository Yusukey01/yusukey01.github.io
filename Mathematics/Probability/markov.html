        <h1>The Core Idea of Markov Chain</h1>
        <blockquote>
            The <strong>Markov chain</strong> is a fundamental concept that appear in various fields. Although the core idea is 
            the same, the way they are used and studied can vary across disciplines. 
            <br><br>
            In the Markov chain, a system transitioning from one state to another is based on the certain probability. 
            The probability of moving to the next state <strong> depends solely on the current state</strong> and 
            not on the sequence of event that preceded it.
            <br><br>
            Let \{X_t\}_{t=0}^{\infty} be the states over time \(t\) then 
            \[
            P(X_{t+1} = j | X_t = i, \, X_{t-1} = i_{t-1}, \cdots, X_0 = i_0) = P(X_{t+1} = j | X_t = i).
            \]
            This <strong>memoryless property</strong> simplifies both the analysis and computation of probabilities.
