                <p>
                    The collection of every possible outcome of an experiment is called a <strong>sample space</strong> denoted as \(S\).
                    It can be discrete or continuous. An <strong>event</strong> \(A\) is a set of outcomes of an experiment, or a 
                    subset of the sample space \(A \subseteq S\). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <strong>probability</strong> of \(A\) denoted as \(P(A)\) satisfies the following axioms:

                    <li>\(P(S) = 1\) and \(P(\emptyset) = 0\) </li>
                    <li>If the events \(A\) and \(B\) are <strong>mutually exclusive</strong>, 
                        \[
                        P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B).
                        \]
                        Note: Mutually exclusive means that the two events \(A\) and \(B\) cannot occur at the same time.

                <p>
                    and can be calculated as: 
                    \[
                    P(A) = \frac{\text{number of outcomes in } A}{\text{number of outcomes in } S}.
                    \]
                </p>
               
                <p>
                    Using event algebra, the following basic facts can be derived:

                        This is the <strong>Binomial coefficient</strong> for the binomial expansion. 
                        We can generalize the binomial coefficient in \(k \geq 2\) groups so that there are \(r_i\) in 
                        group \(i \quad (1 \leq i \leq k)\) and \(r_1 + r_2 + \cdots + r_k = n\):

                        \frac{n!}{r_1 ! r_2 ! \cdots r_k !}
                        \]
                        This is called the <strong>multinomial coefficient</strong>. 
                        <br>For example, if we deal 52 cards evenly among 4 players, giving each player 13 cards, the total 
                        number of different hands within the 4 players is calculated by  
                        \[
                        \frac{52!}{13!13!13!13!}
                        \]

                <h2>Conditional Probability</h2>
                <p>
                    The <strong>conditional probability</strong> of an event \(A\) given an event \(B\) is defined as 
                    \[
                    P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}. \tag{1}
                    \]
                    which means 
                    \[
                    P(A \cap B) = P(A \mid B) P(B).  \tag{2}
                    \]
                    Also, from Equation (1),
                    \[
                    P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}.
                    \]
                    Using Equation (2), 
                    \[
                    P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \mid B) P(B)}{P(A)}.  \tag{3}
                    \]
                    This is known as <strong>Bayes' theorem</strong> or inverse probability law. We will discuss it in a more 
                    useful form later. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If \(A\) and \(B\)  are mutually <strong>independent</strong>, 
                    \[
                    P(A \mid B) = P(A), \text{ and } P(B \mid A) = P(B).
                    \]
                    Thus 
                    \[
                    P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B).
                    \]
                    In addition, in this case, 
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    P(A)P(\bar{B}) &= P(A)[1 - P(B)] \\\\
                                &= P(A) - P(A)P(B) \\\\
                                &= P(A) - P(A \cap B) \\\\
                                &= P(A \cap \bar{B})
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similarly, \( P(\bar{A})P(B) = P(\bar{A} \cap B)\) and \( P(\bar{A})P(\bar{B}) = P(\bar{A} \cap \bar{B})\).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Note: Two events are mutually independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability 
                    of the occurrence of the other event. Be careful not to confuse it with mutually exclusive.

                    We revisit Equation (3):
