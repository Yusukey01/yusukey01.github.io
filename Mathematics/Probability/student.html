            <h2>Student's \(t\)-Distribution</h2>
            <p>
            In general, the normal distribution is sensitive to outliers. A robust alternative to the normal distribution is 
            the <strong>student's \(t\)-distribution</strong>. Its probability density function is given by:
            \[
            f(y | \mu, \sigma^2, \nu) \propto \left[ 1 + \frac{1}{\nu}\left(\frac{y-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2 \right]^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}
            \]
            where \(\mu\) is the mean, \(\sigma > 0\) is the scale parameter(NOT SD), and \(\nu > 0\) is the <strong>degrees of freedom</strong>.
            <br><br>
            The Student \(t\)-distribution has heavy tails(There is more probability mass in the tail than
            with a normal distribution), which makes it robust to outliers.
            <br><br>
            As the degrees of freedom \(\nu\) gets larger, the function acts like the normal distribution. For \(\nu >> 5\), the pdf rapidly approaches 
            a normal distribution and loses its robustness properties.
            <br><br>
            Note:
            \[
            \text{mean } = \text{mode } = \mu, \quad \text{variance } = \frac{\nu \sigma^2}{\nu - 2}
            \]
            and the mean only exists if \(\nu > 1\) and the variance only exists if \(\nu > 2\).

            <h2>Cauchy Distribution</h2>
            <p>
            When \(\nu = 1\), the Student's \(t\)-distribution is known as the <strong>Cauchy distribution</strong>. Its probability density function is given by:
            \[
            f(x | \mu, \gamma) = \frac{1}{\gamma \pi}\left[ 1 + \left(\frac{x - \mu}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]^{-1}.
            \]
            This pdf has heavy tails compared to of the normal distribution. Consider the standard Cauchy distribution (\(\mu = 0, \quad \gamma = 1\)). 
            Then 
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            \mathbb{E }[X] &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x)dx \\\\
                           &= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x}{1 + x^2} dx.
            \end{align*}
            \]
            In short, since the tails are so heavy, <strong>the mean does not converge</strong>.
            (See <a href="../Calculus/riemann.html"><strong>Improper Riemann integrals</strong></a> for the details.)
            <br><br>
            In Bayesian modeling, we want to use a distribution over \(\mathbb{R}^+\) with heavy tails, but finite density 
            at the origin. In such a case, the <strong>half Cauchy distribution</strong> is useful. Its probability density 
            function is given by:
            \[
            f(x | \gamma) = \frac{2}{\pi \gamma} \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{x}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]^{-1}.
            \]
            (The Cauchy distribution with \(\mu = 0\).)

            <section id="laplace" class="section-content">
            <h2>Laplace Distribution</h2>
            <p>
            Like the half Cauchy distribution, because of its heavy tails, the 
            <strong>Laplace distribution (Double sided exponential distribution)</strong> is also popular 
            in some machine learning models such as robust linear regression.
            <br><br>
            Its pdf is given by:
            \[
            \text{Laplace } ( y | \mu, b) = \frac{1}{2b}\exp \left( - \frac{|y - \mu|}{b}\right)
            \]
            where \(\mu\) is a location parameter and \(b > 0\) is a scale parameter. 
            Note:
            \[
            \text{mean } = \text{mode } = \mu, \quad \text{variance } = 2b^2.
            \]
