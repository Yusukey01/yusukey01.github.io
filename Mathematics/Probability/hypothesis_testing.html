        <blockquote>
            Once we have a statistical model (or <strong>hypothesis</strong>), we need to assess whether it's plausible given our data \(\mathcal{D}\). 
            In this section, we introduce <strong>frequentist statistical inference</strong> and <strong>hypothesis testing</strong>. Although 
            <a href="bayesian.html"><strong>Bayesian inference</strong></a> can replace many frequentist techniques and is especially popular in 
            modern machine learning, frequentist methods remain valuable tools â€” they're often simpler to compute, more standardized, and provide 
            complementary insights.
            <br><br>
            Suppose we have two competing hypotheses:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> \(H_0\): This is the default assumption.</li>

                <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis</strong> \(H_1\): This represents the claim we wish to support.</li>
            </ul>
            Our goal is to decide which hypothesis is more plausible. Usually, our reasoning is that if \(H_0\) is very unlikely, 
            then we conclude that \(H_1\) would be true (i.e., we <strong>reject the null hypothesis</strong>).
            <br><br>
            Note: Rejecting \(H_0\) does NOT mean \(H_1\) is absolutely true. Conversely, failing to reject \(H_0\) only means 
            that the evidence is insufficient to support \(H_1\).
