                <h2>Credible Intervals</h2>
                <p>
                    In practice, a probability distribution is often a high-dimensional object, making it difficult to fully capture its characteristics. 
                    In Bayesian statistics, we frequently summarize the uncertainty of a posterior distribution using a <strong>credible interval</strong>. 
                    A credible interval is not the same as a confidence interval in frequentist statistics, even though they may sometimes numerically coincide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Formally, for a given significance level \(\alpha \in (0,1)\), a \(100(1-\alpha)\%\) <strong>credible interval</strong> is defined as:
                    \[
                    C_{\alpha}(\mathcal{D}) = (l, u) \quad \text{such that} \quad P(l \leq \theta \leq u \mid \mathcal{D}) = 1 - \alpha,
                    \]
                    where \(l\) and \(u\) denote the lower and upper bounds, respectively. Here, \(\mathcal{D}\) represents the observed data, and the probability is computed under the posterior distribution \(p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D})\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This interval contains \(1-\alpha\) of the posterior probability mass. A common choice is the <strong>central credible interval</strong>, where \(\frac{1-\alpha}{2}\) of the posterior probability lies in each tail. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the cumulative distribution function (cdf) \(F\) of the posterior distribution is known, the central credible interval can be computed as:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    l &= F^{-1}\left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right), \\\\
                    u &= F^{-1}\left( 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2} \right),
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    where \(F^{-1}\) denotes the quantile function (the inverse of the cdf).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an example, if the posterior distribution is approximately normal with posterior mean \(\mu\) and posterior standard deviation \(\sigma\), 
                    a rough \(95\%\) credible interval can be set as:
                    \[
                    (l, u) = (\mu - 2\sigma, \mu + 2\sigma),
                    \]
                    because for a standard normal distribution \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\), approximately \(95\%\) of the probability mass lies within two standard deviations from the mean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More precisely, when \(p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D}) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)\) and \(\alpha = 0.05\), the central credible interval endpoints are:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    l &= \mu + \sigma \Phi^{-1}\left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right), \\\\
                    u &= \mu + \sigma \Phi^{-1}\left( 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2} \right),
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    where \(\Phi\) is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the standard normal distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, if the posterior distribution is the standard normal \(p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D}) = \mathcal{N}(0,1)\), then:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    l &= \Phi^{-1}(0.025) \approx -1.96, \\\\
                    u &= \Phi^{-1}(0.975) \approx 1.96,
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    so the \(95\%\) credible interval is approximately \((-1.96, 1.96)\).

                <h2>Monte Carlo Approximation</h2>
                <p> 
                    In general, it is often difficult to compute the inverse cdf of the posterior distribution exactly. 
                    In such cases, a simple and practical alternative is to use a <strong>Monte Carlo approximation</strong> 
                    based on samples drawn from the posterior. 
                </p> 
                <p> 
                    Suppose we can generate samples \(\theta^{(1)}, \theta^{(2)}, \dots, \theta^{(S)}\) independently from the posterior \(p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D})\).
                    Then, to approximate a \((1-\alpha)\)% credible interval:
                </p> 
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;"> 
                    <li>Sort the samples in increasing order: \(\theta^{(1)} \leq \theta^{(2)} \leq \cdots \leq \theta^{(S)}\).</li> 
                    <li>Set the lower endpoint \(l\) to be the \(\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\)-quantile, and the upper endpoint \(u\) to be the \(\left(1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\)-quantile.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p> 
                    More precisely, approximate:
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    l &\approx \theta^{\left(\left\lceil S \times \frac{\alpha}{2} \right\rceil\right)}, \\\\
                    u &\approx \theta^{\left(\left\lceil S \times \left(1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}\right) \right\rceil\right)},
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    where \(\lceil \cdot \rceil\) denotes the ceiling function, rounding up to the nearest integer if necessary.
                </p> 
                <p> 
                    Intuitively, instead of computing the inverse cdf analytically, we use the <strong>empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf)</strong> 
                    formed by the sorted samples to estimate the desired quantiles. 
                    As the number of samples \(S \to \infty\), the empirical quantiles converge to the true quantiles of the posterior by the law of large numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Monte Carlo method is especially powerful when the posterior distribution is complex or high-dimensional, and no closed-form expression 
                    for the cdf or its inverse is available.
                </p>

                <p>
                Monte Carlo methods are widely used in Bayesian statistics to approximate posterior distributions, especially when closed-form solutions are unavailable. 
                One common use is estimating credible intervals based on random samples drawn from the posterior.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                To approximate a central credible interval using Monte Carlo sampling:
                </p>
                
                <ol style="padding-left: 40px;">
                  <li>Draw many random samples from the posterior distribution</li>
                  <li>Sort the samples in ascending order</li>
                  <li>Select the appropriate quantiles (e.g., the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles for a 95% interval)</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>
                As the number of samples increases, this method provides a better approximation of the overall posterior distribution. However, using quantiles to estimate credible intervals assumes that the distribution is roughly unimodal and symmetric. This can lead to misleading intervals in more complex scenarios.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                For example, in a <strong>bimodal distribution</strong> (where the posterior has two distinct peaks), the computed interval may:
                </p>
                
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                  <li>Fall in a low-probability region between the modes</li>
                  <li>Omit one of the modes entirely</li>
                  <li>Misrepresent the true uncertainty or variability in the parameter</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                While Monte Carlo sampling still gives valuable insight into the shape of the distribution, <strong>quantile-based credible intervals can fail</strong> in multimodal or highly skewed settings. In such cases, alternative approaches like 
                <strong>highest posterior density (HPD) intervals</strong>, density plots, or more sophisticated sampling techniques are more appropriate.
