                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Up until this chapter, we relied on calculus and linear algebra to solve optimization problems.
                    For many practical machine learning applications, these tools are sufficient. However, as we move toward
                    advanced topics like manifold learning or information geometry, intuition alone is no longer enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We need to be able to formally answer questions such as: "Does this optimization algorithm truly converge?" or 
                    "How do we define the structure of a space when we treat entire functions as single points?" To address these, we must 
                    shift from concrete computation to mathematical analysis. Concepts like completeness and topology are not just theoretical 
                    abstractions; they are the formal requirements that ensure our optimization paths actually lead to a solution.

                <p>
                    Remember, In <a href="../Linear_algebra/trace.html#ms"><strong>Section I</strong></a> we defined the measure space 
                    as follows.

                    <p>
                        A <strong>metric space</strong> is an ordered pair \((M, d)\)consisting of a nonempty set 
                        \(M\) and a <strong>metric</strong> \(d\) on \(M\). The metric \(d\) is a function 
                        \(d: M \times M \to \mathbb{R}\) that defines the distance between any two elements of \(M\). 
                        For all \(a, b, c \in M\), the following axioms must hold:

                        <li>Positivity: \(d(a,b) \geq 0\) with equality if and only if \(a = b\).</li>
                        <li>Symmetry: \(d(a,b) = d(b,a)\).</li>
                        <li>The triangle inequality \(d(a,b) \leq d(a,c) + d(c, b)\).</li>

                <p>
                    Like the set theory, for two metric spaces \((X, d)\) and \((Y, e)\), we can say that \(X\) is a 
                    <strong>metric subspace</strong> of \(Y\) and \(Y\) is a <strong>metric superspace</strong> of \(X\) iff 
                    \(X\) is a subset of \(Y\) and \(d\) is a restriction of \(e\).

                    Moreover, the metric subspace \((\phi(X), e)\) of \(Y, e\) is an <strong>isometric copy</strong> of the
