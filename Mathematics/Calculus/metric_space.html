                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Up until this chapter, we relied on calculus and linear algebra to solve optimization problems.
                    For many practical machine learning applications, these tools are sufficient. However, as we move toward
                    advanced topics like manifold learning or information geometry, intuition alone is no longer enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We need to be able to formally answer questions such as: "Does this optimization algorithm truly converge?" or 
                    "How do we define the structure of a space when we treat entire functions as single points?" To address these, we must 
                    shift from concrete computation to mathematical analysis. Concepts like completeness and topology are not just theoretical 
                    abstractions; they are the formal requirements that ensure our optimization paths actually lead to a solution.

                <p>
                    Remember, In <a href="../Linear_algebra/trace.html#ms"><strong>Section I</strong></a> we defined the measure space and metric
                    as follows.

                        A <strong>metric space</strong> is an ordered pair \((M, d)\)consisting of a nonempty set 
                        \(M\) and a <strong>metric</strong> \(d\) on \(M\). The metric \(d\) is a function 
                        \(d: M \times M \to \mathbb{R}\) that defines the distance between any two elements of \(M\). 
                        For all \(a, b, c \in M\), the following axioms must hold:
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Like the set theory, for two metric spaces \((X, d)\) and \((Y, e)\), we can define that \(X\) is a 
                    <strong>metric subspace</strong> of \(Y\) and \(Y\) is a <strong>metric superspace</strong> of \(X\) if and 
                    only if \(X\) is a subset of \(Y\) and \(d\) is a restriction of \(e\).

                    Intuitively, we want to say that the open ball in \(X\) is the open subset of \(X\), and similary, the closed ball in \(X\) 
                    is the closed subset of \(X\). Indeed, these are true. We shall show that only the open ball case here. 
                </p>

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof: The Open Ball is Open</span>
                    Suppose \(X, d\) is a metric space, \(x \in X\), and \(r \in \mathbb{R}^+\). Consider the open ball 
                    \[
                    \mathcal{B}[x ; r) = \{y \in X \mid d(x, y) < r\} \subseteq X.
                    \]
                    If \(z \in \mathcal{B}\), then 
                    \[
                    \exists s \in (0, r) \text{ such that } d(x, z) < r - s.
                    \]
                    Now, consider any point \(w\) outside the ball, i.e., \(w \in X \setminus \mathcal{B}\). 
                    By definition, \(d(w, x) \geq r\). Using the triangle inequality, we have:
                    \[
                    d(z, w) \geq d(w, x) - d(x, z) > s. 
                    \]
                    Since \(w\) is an arbitrary point in the complement \(X \setminus \mathcal{B}\), 
                    this inequality holds for all points outside the ball. This implies that the 
                    "shortest distance" (infimum) from \(z\) to the outside the bal is at least \(s\):
                    \[
                    \text{dist }(z, X \setminus \mathcal{B}) = \inf \{d(z, w) \mid w \notin \mathcal{B}\} \geq s.
                    \]
                    Recall the definition of a <strong>boundary point</strong> requires the distance to the complement to be zero. 
                    Since the distance here is strictly positive (\(\geq s\)), \(z\) is <strong>not</strong> a boundary point. 
                    Therefore, being in \(\mathcal{B}\) but not on its boundary, \(z\) must be in the interior:
                    \[
                    z \in \mathcal{B}^{\circ}.
                    \]
                    Since \(z\) was chosen arbitrarily, every point in \(\mathcal{B}\) is an interior point: 
                    \[
                    \mathcal{B} = \mathcal{B}^{\circ}.
                    \]
                    Therefore, \(\mathcal{B}\) is open.

                    In the <strong>normed linear space</strong>, open (closed) balls are <strong>convex</strong> and have identical shape, each being 
                    a translation of every other open (closed) balls of the same radius. So, we can re-define what convex is more formally.

                    Suppose \(V\) is a normed linear space and \(C \subseteq V). Then \(C\) is said to be <strong>convex</strong> if and only if 
                    for each \(a, b \in C\), the line segment \(\{ (1 - t)a + tb \mid t \in [0, 1] \}\) jointing \(a\) and \(b\) is included in 
                    \(C\).
