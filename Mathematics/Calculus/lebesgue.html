                <h2>Abstract Integration</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Lebesgue integration</strong> is sometimes referred to as <strong>abstract integration</strong>. The reason is that the 
                    Lebesgue integral is developed in the very general setting of a <a href="measure.html"><strong>measure space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)\)</strong></a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We want to define the integral:
                    \[
                    \int_{\Omega} g(\omega) \, d\mu(\omega)
                    \]
                    of a measurable function \(g: \Omega \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}\) defined on a measure space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note: \(\overline{\mathbb{R}}\) refers to the extended set of real values, which includes \(\infty\) and \(-\infty\). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let's check some special cases:<br>
                    If the measure space is a <strong>probability space</strong>:\((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\), and \(X: \Omega \to \bar{\mathbb{R}}\) is 
                    measurable, which means \(X\) is an extended-valued random variable, then the integral is the expectation of \(X\):
                    \[
                    \int_{\Omega} X \, d\mathbb{P} = \mathbb{E }(X).
                    \]
                    If we define the measure space as \((\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}, \lambda)\) where \(\mathcal{B}\) is the Borel 
                    \(\sigma\)-algebra and \(\lambda\) is the Lebesgue measure, then the integral is a generalization of the usual integral 
                    encountered in calculus:
                    \[
                    \int_{\mathbb{R}} g \, d\lambda = \int g(x) dx.
                    \]
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So, even if it isn't always stated explicitly, many of the integrals we have encountered - whether in the context of computing 
                    expectations in probability theory or evaluating integrals on the real line - can be defined using Lebesgue integration. 
                    This approach is the core of modern analysis and probability, providing a robust framework for handling functions that may 
                    be too irregular or complex for the Riemann integration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the key advantages of this abstract approach is that the Lebesgue integral is insensitive to what happens on sets 
                    of <strong>measure zero</strong>. This allows us to integrate highly discontinuous functions, such as the Dirichlet function, 
                    which the Riemann integral fails to handle.

                <h2>Characteristic function</h2>

                 <p>
                    Before we define the Lebesgue integral in full generality, we need a fundamental tool that allows us to 
                    "isolate" or "focus on" specific regions of our measure space. This is where the <strong>characteristic function</strong> 
                    comes in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The characteristic function is deceptively simple — it's essentially a mathematical "switch" that turns a function 
                    "on" over a specific set and "off" everywhere else. Despite its simplicity, this concept is crucial for building 
                    up the Lebesgue integral from basic building blocks to arbitrarily complex measurable functions.
                </p>

                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Characteristic Function (Indicator Function)</span>
                     <p>
                        The <strong>characteristic function</strong> (or <strong>indicator function</strong>) of a set \(B\), denoted 
                        \(\chi_B\) or \(1_B\), is defined as:
                        \[
                        \chi_B(\omega) =  \begin{cases}  
                                            1 & \text{if \(\omega \in B\)}\\
                                            0 & \text{if \(\omega \notin B\)}.
                                            \end{cases}
                        \]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The integral over a measurable subset \(B\) of \(g\) is then defined by 
                        \[
                        \int_B g \, d\mu = \int (\chi_B \, g)d\mu
                        \]
                        where 
                        \[
                        (\chi_B \, g) (\omega) =  \begin{cases}  
                                                    g(\omega) & \text{if \(\omega \in B\)}\\
                                                    0         & \text{if \(\omega \notin B\)}.
                                                    \end{cases}
                        \]
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    We will use the term <strong>"almost everywhere"(a.e.)</strong> to mean "for all \(\omega\) outside 
                    a zero-measure subset of \(\Omega\). So, we "ignore" a set of \(\omega\)'s that has measure zero. 
                    For the special case of probability measure, we also use <strong>"almost surely"(a.s.)</strong>.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, 
                    \[
                    g_n \uparrow g, \, a.e.
                    \]
                    means that the increasing monotonic convergence of \(g_n(\omega)\) to \(g(\omega)\) holds \(\forall \omega \in \Omega\) 
                    outside a zero-measure set.

                    <p>
                        A function \(g: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\) is said to be <strong>simple</strong> if it 
                        is measurable, finite, and takes only finitely many different values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If \(g\) is a simple function of the form:
                        \[
                        g(\omega) = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i \chi_{A_i}(\omega), \quad \forall \omega \in \Omega
                        \]
                        where \(k\) is a positive integer, \(a_i \in \mathbb{R}\), and \(A_i\) are 
                        pairwise disjoint measurable sets, then its integral is defined by 
                        \[
                        \int g \, d\mu = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i \mu(A_i).

                <p>
                    <strong>Convention:</strong> We adopt the standard measure-theoretic convention that \(0 \cdot \infty = 0\). 
                    This ensures that \(a_i \mu(A_i) = 0\) whenever \(a_i = 0\), even if \(\mu(A_i) = \infty\).

                    <span class="proof-title">Example: Dirichlet function</span>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we can compute the integral of the <strong>Dirichlet function</strong> on the interval 
                        on the interval \([0, 1]\): 
                        \[
                        f(x)=
                        \begin{cases}
                        1 &\text{if \(x \in \mathbb{Q}\)} \\
                        0 &\text{if \(x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}\)}
                        \end{cases}
                        \]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Dirichlet function is a simple function since it only takes on the two values 0 and 1. By the definiton: 
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        \int_0^1 f(x)dx &= \int_0^1 \chi_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) dx\\\\
                                        &= 1 \cdot \mu([0, 1] \cap \mathbb{Q}) + 0 \cdot \mu([0, 1] \setminus \mathbb{Q}) \\\\
                                        &= 1 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot (1 - 0) \\\\
                                        &= 0.
                        \end{align*}
                        \]
                        So, the Dirichlet function is 0 <em>almost everywhere</em>. Even though there are infinitely many rational numbers 
                        where the function is 1, their "weight" (measure) in the continuum of real numbers is zero.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: Technically, for any interval \([a, b]\), the Lebesgue integral of the Dirichlet function is 0 
                        because the Lebesgue measure of any countable set is zero.

                <div class="insight-box">
                    <h3>Insight: "Generally Speaking"</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the real world, strict logical implications like \(P \implies Q\) are incredibly rare. 
                        When we say "Generally, A implies B," we are often mentally suppressing thousands of lines 
                        of "exception handling" code.
                        In measure theory, we can formalize this "generally" using the concept of 
                        <strong>"almost everywhere" (a.e.)</strong>. Instead of demanding that a property holds for 
                        <em>every</em> single point (which is often too brittle for complex systems), we allow for a 
                        set of exceptions, provided that their <strong>measure is zero</strong>.
                        As seen in the <strong>Dirichlet function</strong> example above, even though there are 
                        infinitely many points where the function is 1, they have zero "weight" in the eyes of the 
                        Lebesgue integral. 
                        By using <strong>a.e.</strong>, we gain a powerful way to "compress" information without losing 
                        logical rigor. We aren't just being vague; we are mathematically proving that the exceptions don't 
                        affect the overall "structure" or "integral" of the system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When measure theory is applied to probability, <strong>"almost everywhere"</strong> is referred to as <strong>"almost surely" (a.s.)</strong>. 
                        This distinction is vital for understanding how we handle "impossible" events.
                        Consider flipping a fair coin infinitely many times. From a <strong>set-theoretic perspective</strong>, a sequence of 
                        "all heads" (H, H, H, ...) is a "valid" element of the sample space \(\Omega\). It is logically "possible" in the sense 
                        that the set is not empty.
                        However, from a <strong>measure-theoretic perspective</strong>, the probability measure assigned to this specific singleton set is 
                        <strong>exactly zero</strong>. 
                        This is why the Law of Large Numbers states that the mean "converges" to \(1/2\) <em>almost surely</em>. It acknowledges that 
                        while non-convergent sequences exist as mathematical objects, their total "weight" is zero, allowing us to treat the convergence 
                        as a certainty in any functional system.

                    Consider a measurable function \(g: \Omega \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}\). Let
                    \[

                    \]
                    Note that \(A_+\) and \(A_-\) are measurable sets, and \(g_+\), \(g_-\) are both nonnegative 
                    (possibly extended-valued) measurable functions.

                    if we have both \(\int g_+ \, d\mu < \infty\) and \(\int g_- \, d\mu < \infty\). 
                    <br><br>
                    Note: The definition implies there exists a function that is NOT Lebesgue integrable over some interval. In general, 
                    if a function is Riemann integrable, the function is also Lebesgue integrable and 
                    \[

                        \[
                        \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx 
                        \]
                        This is known to converge to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\): 
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b \frac{\sin x}{x} dx \\\\
                                                            &= \frac{\pi}{2}
                        \end{align*}
                        \]
                        So, \(f\) is improperly Riemann integrable on \([0, \infty)\).

                        On the other hand, in the Lebesgue sense: 
                        \[
                        \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx = \int_0^{\infty} \left(\frac{\sin x}{x}\right)_+ dx - \int_0^{\infty} \left(\frac{\sin x}{x}\right)_- dx 
                        \]
                        \(\sin x\) is always positive on the interval \([2\pi n, 2\pi n + \pi]\), and then 
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        \int_0^{\infty} \left(\frac{\sin x}{x}\right)_+ dx &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_{2\pi n}^{2\pi n + \pi} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx \\\\
                        &\geq \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_{2\pi n}^{2\pi n + \pi} \frac{\sin x}{2 \pi n + \pi} dx \tag{**} \\\\
                        &=  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{2}{\pi(2n +1)} \\\\
                        &= \infty
                        \end{align*}
                        \]
                        and similarly, \(\int_0^{\infty} \left(\frac{\sin x}{x}\right)_- dx = \infty\).
                        Thus, by the definition, this is NOT integrable in the Lebesgue sense.

                        ** Since \(x \leq 2\pi n + \pi\) on this interval, we have \(\frac{1}{x} \geq \frac{1}{2\pi n + \pi}\).
