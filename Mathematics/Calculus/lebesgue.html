        <h1>Abstract Integration</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Lebesgue integration</strong> is sometimes referred to as <strong>abstract integration</strong>. The reason is that the 
            Lebesgue integral is developed in the very general setting of a <a href="measure.html">measure space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)\)</a>.
            <br><br>
            We want to define the integral:
            \[
            \int_{\Omega} g(\omega) d\mu(\omega)
            \]
            of a measurable function \(g: \Omega \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}\) defined on a measure space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)\).
            <br>
            Note: \(\overline{\mathbb{R}}\) refers to the extended set of real values, which includes \(\infty\) and \(-\infty\). 
            <br><br>
            Let's check some special cases:
            <br>
            If the measure space is a <strong>probability space</strong>:\((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\), and \(X: \Omega \to \bar{\mathbb{R}}\) is 
            measurable, which means \(X\) is an extended-valued random variable, then the integral is the expectation of \(X\):
            \[
            \int_{\Omega} X d\mathbb{P} = \mathbb{E }(X).
            \]
            <br><br>
            If we define the measure space as \((\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}, \lambda)\) where \(\mathcal{B}\) is the Borel 
            \(\sigma\)-algebra and \(\lambda\) is he Lebesgue measure, then the integral is a generalization of the usual integral 
            encountered in calculus:
            \[
            \int_{\mathbb{R}} g d\lambda = \int g(x) dx.
            \]
            <br>
            So, even if it isn't always stated explicitly, many of the integrals we have encountered — whether in the context of computing 
            expectations in probability theory or evaluating integrals on the real line — can be defined using Lebesgue integration. 
            This approach is the core of modern analysis and probability, providing a robust framework for handling functions that may 
            be too irregular or complex for the Riemann integration.

        <h1>Characteristic function</h1>
        <blockquote>
            The integral over a measurable subset \(B\) of \(g\) is defined by 
            \[
            \int_B g \, d\mu = \int (\chi_B \, g)d\mu
            \]
            where \(\chi_B = 1_B\) is a <strong>characteristic function(or indicator function)</strong> so that
            \[
            (\chi_B \, g) (\omega) =  \begin{cases}  
                                        g(\omega) & \text{if \(\omega \in B\)}\\
                                        0         & \text{if \(\omega \notin B\)}.
                                        \end{cases}
            \]
            <br>
            We will use the term <strong>"almost everywhere"(a.e.)</strong> to mean "for all \(\omega\) outside 
            a zero-measure subset of \(\Omega\). So, we "ignore" a set of \(omega\)'s that has measure zero. 
            For the special case of probability measure, we also use <strong>"almost surely"(a.s.)</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <h1>Nonnegative Simple Function</h1>
        <blockquote> 
            A function \(g: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\) is said to be <strong>simple</strong> if it 
            is measurable, finite and takes only finitely many different values.
            <br><br>
            If \(g\) is a simple function of the form:
            \[
            g(\omega) = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i 1_{A_i}(\omega), \quad \forall \omega \in \Omega
            \]
            its integral is defined by 
            \[
            \int g \, d\mu = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i \mu(A_i).
            \]
            We assume \(a_i \mu(A_i) = 0\) if \(a_i = 0\) and \(\mu(A_i) = \infty\).

                <span class="proof-title">Revisit our Problem:</span>
                Remember, in the previous section, we encountered the following problem:
                <br>
                Consider the <strong>Dirichlet function</strong>: 
                \[
                f(x)=
                \begin{cases}
                1 &\text{if \(x \in \mathbb{Q}\)} \\
                0 &\text{if \(x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}\)}
                \end{cases}
                \]
                compute:  
                \[
                \int_0^1 f(x)dx
                \]
                <br><br>
                Now, we can see the interval \([0, 1]\) as the sample space \(\Omega\). The smallest \(\sigma\)-algebra that contains 
                every interval \([a, b] \subset [0, 1]\) is the <strong>Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra</strong>. Moreover, 
                the Dirichlet function is measurable with respect to the Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra because both the set of 
                rationals: \(\mathbb{Q} \cap [0, 1]\) and irrationals \([0, 1] \setminus \mathbb{Q}\) are Borel sets. Therefore, in short, 
                the Dirichlet function is <strong>Lebesgue measurable</strong>.
