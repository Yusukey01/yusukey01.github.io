                <p>
                    In the previous chapter, we introduced completeness as a property ensuring that a metric space 
                    has "no holes." We stated that complete spaces are those where every Cauchy sequence converges. 
                    But what exactly <em>is</em> convergence in a metric space? And what is a Cauchy sequence?
                </p>

                <p>
                    These questions are not merely technical—they are fundamental to understanding why optimization 
                    algorithms work. When gradient descent produces a sequence of iterates 
                    \(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots\), we need precise language to say what it 
                    means for this sequence to "approach" a solution, and under what conditions we can guarantee 
                    that a limit actually exists.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This chapter formalizes convergence in the general metric space setting, develops the theory of 
                    Cauchy sequences, and establishes the deep connection between these concepts and completeness.

                    Here we want to generalize the familier \(\epsilon - \delta\) notion from elementary calculus to arbitrary 
                    metric spaces. Why it does matter for advanced machine learning?

                    is called the \(m\)th <strong>tail</strong> of the sequence \((x_n)\).

                    <span class="theorem-title">Definiton: Convergence and Limit</span> 
                    Suppose \(X\) is a metric space, \(z \in X\) and \((x_n)\) is a sequence in \(X\). We say that \((x_n)\) 
                    <strong>converges</strong> to \(z\) in \(X\), written \(x_n \to z\) if and only if every open subset of \(X\) that contains \(z\) 
                    includes a <strong>tail</strong> of \((x_n)\). Furthermore, \(z\) is called the <strong>limit</strong> of \((x_n)\) denoted by \(\lim x_n\).

                <p>
                    Convergence in a metric space can be characterized through multiple equivalent lenses:

                    Suppose \(X\) is a metric space, \(z \in X\) and \((x_n)\) is a sequence in \(X\). The following statements 
                    are logically equivalent:

                        <li>\(\big\cap \left\{\overline{x_n \mid n \in S\} \mid S \subseteq \mathbb{N}, S \text{infinite}\right\} = \{z\}\).</li>

                        <li>\(\text{dist }(z, \{x_n \mid n \in S\}) = 0\) for every infinte subset \(S\) of \(\mathbb{N}\).</li>
                        <li>Every open ball centred at \(z\) includes a tail of \(x_n\).</li>

                <p>
                   Note that the 5th criterion explains what the convergence is by the topological perspective. Beyond numerical distances, 
                   \(z\) is the limit because the sequence eventually enters and never leaves any <strong>open</strong> "neighborhod" of \(z\).
                </p>

                <p>Remember, convergent sequences of real numbers can converge to "at most" one point, which is, in short, because \(\mathbb{R}\) is the 
                    metric space. So, the uniqueness of limits holds in any metric space.

                    Then \((x_n)\) converges to exactly one point in \(X\).

                    Suppose \(w, z \in X\) and \((x_n)\) converges to both \(w\) and \(z\).  Then 
                    \[
                    \big\cap \left\{\overline{x_n \mid n \in S\} \mid S \subseteq \mathbb{N}, S \text{infinite}\right\} = \{w\}.
                    \]
                    and 
                    \[
                    \big\cap \left\{\overline{x_n \mid n \in S\} \mid S \subseteq \mathbb{N}, S \text{infinite}\right\} = \{z\}.

                    Note that any subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit as the parent sequence. In other words, 
                    convergence is robust against any infinite sub-sampling and always identifies a single, well-defined limit in practice.

                    In optimization, we often don't know the limit point \(x^*\) in advance. We can check if iterates 
                    are getting closer to "each other" (Cauchy), but checking convergence requires knowing the target.

                    How do we know a sequence "should" converge without knowing the limit? We need alternative formulation 
                    of convergent sequences that does not use the limit.

                    <strong>Cauchy sequence</strong> in \(X\) if and only if for every \(r \in \mathbb{R}^+\), there is 
                    a ball of \(X\) of radius\(r\) that includes a tail of \(x_n\).

                    This is because the 4th criterion of <strong>Theorem: Criteria for Convergence</strong> implies
