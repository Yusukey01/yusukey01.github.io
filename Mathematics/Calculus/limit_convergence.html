                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    In the previous chapter, we introduced completeness as a property ensuring that a metric space 
                    has "no holes." We stated that complete spaces are those where every Cauchy sequence converges. 
                    But what exactly <em>is</em> convergence in a metric space? And what is a Cauchy sequence?
                </p>

                <p>
                    These questions are not merely technical—they are fundamental to understanding why optimization 
                    algorithms work. When gradient descent produces a sequence of iterates 
                    \(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots\), we need precise language to say what it 
                    means for this sequence to "approach" a solution, and under what conditions we can guarantee 
                    that a limit actually exists.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This chapter formalizes convergence in the general metric space setting, develops the theory of 
                    Cauchy sequences, and establishes the deep connection between these concepts and completeness.

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definiton: Tails</span>
                    Suppose \(X\) is a non-empty set and \(x = (x_n)\) is a sequence in \(X\). For each \(m \in \mathbb{N}\), the 
                    set 
                    \[
                    \text{tail}_m (x) = \{x_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N}, n \geq m\}

                    is called the \(m\)th <strong>tail</strong> of the sequence \((x_n)\).
                </div>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definiton: Convergence and Limit</span> 
                    Suppose \(X\) is a metric space, \(z \in X\) and \((x_n)\) is a sequence in \(X\). We say that \((x_n)\) 
                    <strong>converges</strong> to \(z\) in \(X\), written \(x_n \to z\) if and only if every open subset of \(X\) that contains \(z\) 
                    includes a <strong>tail</strong> of \((x_n)\). Furthermore, \(z\) is called the <strong>limit</strong> of \((x_n)\) denoted by \(\lim x_n\).

                <p>
                    Now, we have more freedom to explain what convergence is.

                <p>Remember, convergent sequences of real numbers can converge to "at most" one point, which is, in short, because \(\mathbb{R}\) is the 
                    metric space. So, the uniqueness of limits holds in any metric space. 
                </p>

                    <span class="theorem-title">Theorem: The Uniqueness of Limits</span>
                    Suppose \(X\) is a metric space, and \((x_n)\) is a sequence in \(X\) that converges in \(X\). 
                    Then \((x_n)\) converges to exactly one point in \(X\).
                    \(X\).
                </div>

                <div class="proof">
                    <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                    Suppose \(w, z \in X\) and \((x_n)\) converges to both \(w\) and \(z\).  Then 
                    \[
                    \big\cap \left\{\overline{x_n \mid n \in S\} \mid S \subseteq \mathbb{N}, S \text{infinite}\right\} = \{w\}.
                    \]
                    and 
                    \[
                    \big\cap \left\{\overline{x_n \mid n \in S\} \mid S \subseteq \mathbb{N}, S \text{infinite}\right\} = \{z\}.
                    \]
                    Thus, \(\{w\} = \{z\}\), and \(w = z\).
