                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    We brifly, introduced completeness in an earlier chapters as a property ensuring metric spaces have 
                    "no holes." Now, equipped with the theory of convergence and Cauchy sequences, we can develop 
                    completeness fully and prove one of the most important theorems in analysis: the 
                    <strong>Banach's Fixed-Point Theorem</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This theorem states that in a complete metric space, every contraction mapping has a unique 
                    fixed point, and iterative application of the mapping converges to that fixed point. This is 
                    not an abstract curiosity. It is the theoretical backbone of countless algorithms: Newton's 
                    method, value iteration in reinforcement learning, and many optimization schemes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Understanding <em>why</em> these algorithms converge requires understanding completeness at a 
                    deeper level than our initial preview allowed.

                    Remember, we introduced the universal criterion for completeness as the first definition of 
                    a complete metric space. (See <a href="metric_space.html"><strong>Part 16</strong></a>.)

                    After that, we discussed the completeness in termes of the Cauchy sequence.

                        <li>Newton's method:<br>
                            for solving \(f(x) = 0\) under suitable conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Gradient descent:<br>
                                \(x_{n+1} = x_n - \alpha \nabla f(x_n)\).
                        </li>
                        <li>Proximal methods:<br>
                            \(x_{n+1} = \text{prox}_{\alpha g}(x_n - \alpha \nabla f(x_n))\).
                        </li>
                        <li>Value iteration:<br> 
                            \(V_{n+1} = T(V_n)\) where \(T\) is the Bellman operator. If we can show T is a contraction on a complete space, 
                            convergence is guaranteed with a known rate.
