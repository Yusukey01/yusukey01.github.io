                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this curriculum, we have invoked the <strong>Extreme Value Theorem</strong>: a 
                    continuous function on a closed and bounded set attains its maximum and minimum. This theorem 
                    is the reason we can speak of "optimal solutions" in constrained optimization—it guarantees 
                    they exist.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But what exactly is special about "closed and bounded"? The answer is <strong>compactness</strong>. 
                    In \(\mathbb{R}^n\), compactness is equivalent to being closed and bounded (the Heine-Borel theorem). 
                    In general metric spaces, compactness is more subtle—but equally powerful.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Compactness captures the idea that a set is "finite-like" in a topological sense: you cannot 
                    escape to infinity, and sequences cannot wander forever without accumulating somewhere. This 
                    chapter formalizes compactness and proves why it guarantees the existence of extrema.
