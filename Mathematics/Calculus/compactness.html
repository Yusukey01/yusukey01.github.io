                <p>
                    It would be natural that we are able to find optimal solution(s) in constrained optimization methods. 
                    The Extreme Value Theorem guarnatees that a continuous function on a <strong>closed and bounded</strong> 
                    set attains its maximum and minimum. Precisely speaking, this theorem works because in (\mathbb{R}^n\), 
                    being closed and bounded is equivalent to <strong>compactness</strong>.

                    In general metric spaces, compactness is more subtle, but equally powerful. Compactness captures the idea 
                    that a set is "finite-like" in a topological sense. In a compact metric space, sequences cannot wander 
                    forever without accumulating somewhere, and  local properties can be stitched together to control the 
                    entire space with finite resources.

                <h2>Open Covers and Compactness</h2>

                <p>
                    While completeness focuses on the "internal" stability of sequences, compactness addresses the "external" finiteness 
                    of the space. The definition via <strong>open covers</strong> is the most robust because it relies purely on topological structure rather 
                    than specific distance values. This allows us to analyze global properties by "stitching together" local coordinate 
                    patches — a technique fundamental to Manifold Theory.

                    Compactness is a multifaceted property. In metric spaces, several distinct conditions converge to describe the 
                    same underlying structure of "finiteness within infinity." Understanding these equivalences is essential for 
                    moving toward advanced fields like Manifold Theory and Information Geometry.

                    <p>
                        Intuitively, if a set is not compact, it has "holes" (missing limit points) or "ends" that stretch 
                        to infinity, allowing us to define a cover that requires infinitely many sets to handle the 
                        boundary or the unbounded tail. Compactness asserts that no matter how small or localized our 
                        open sets are, we only need a finite number of them to capture the entire space.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Note: While "holes" often refer to the lack of completeness (missing limit points of Cauchy sequences), 
                        compactness prevents a broader sense of "escapes." It ensures the set is both complete and totally bounded, 
                        leaving no room for sequences to drift to infinity or fall through boundary gaps.

                        This property ensures that an algorithm confined to a compact region cannot "wander off" indefinitely. 
                        Even if the sequence itself does not converge, it must have accumulation points within the set. 
                        This is the core mechanism behind convergence proofs for many iterative methods in machine learning.

                <p>
                    While the open cover definition is powerful, checking "every" open cover is difficult. Fortunately, 
                    in the familiar Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^n\), compactness has a simple geometric characterization.

                        A subset \(K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is compact if and only if it is:

                    In <strong>infinite</strong>-dimensional spaces (such as spaces of functions used in Functional Analysis or RKHS in kernel methods), 
                    a closed and bounded set is <strong>not necessarily compact</strong>. This distinction is critical when analyzing 
                    the convergence of functions rather than simple vectors.

                        In optimization, constraints like \( \|w\|_2 \le C \) (L2 regularization) create a closed and bounded 
                        feasible set in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). By the Heine-Borel theorem, this set is compact. This geometry 
                        is what theoretically guarantees that regularization penalties prevent weights from exploding and 
                        stabilize the learning process.

                    Since a compact subset of \(\mathbb{R}\) must be closed and bounded (Heine-Borel), the image of a 
                    continuous real-valued function on a compact set must have a maximum and a minimum element.

                        Let \(K\) be a compact metric space and \(f: K \to \mathbb{R}\) be a continuous function. 
                        Then \(f\) is bounded and attains its maximum and minimum values. That is, there exist 
                        \(x_{\min}, x_{\max} \in K\) such that for all \(x \in K\):
                        \[

                        The EVT is the bedrock of loss minimization. If our parameter space is compact (e.g., via regularization constraints) 
                        and our loss function is continuous, we are mathematically guaranteed that a global minimum exists. 
                        Without compactness (e.g., on an open interval or unbounded set), the function might only approach an 
                        infimum asymptotically (like \(f(x) = 1/x\) on \((1, \infty)\)), leaving us chasing a solution that isn't there.
