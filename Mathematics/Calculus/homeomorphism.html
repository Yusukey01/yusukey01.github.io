                    In previous chapters, we analyzed specific behaviors of metric spaces such as convergence, boundedness, 
                    continuity, comppleteness, connectedness, and compactness. However, we have not yet defined when two different 
                    spaces are "essentially" the same. While <strong>isometry</strong> preserves distances, it is often too rigid 
                    for modern data analysis. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Homeomorphism</strong> provides a more flexible concept of equivalence known as <strong>topological equivalence</strong>. 
                    It describes a scenario where one space can be continuously deformed into another without tearing or gluing, which is fundamental 
                    for understanding how neural networks transform <strong>data manifolds</strong> in latent space.
