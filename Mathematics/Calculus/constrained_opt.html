        <h1>Constrained Optimization Problem</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Consider the <strong>constrained optimization problem</strong>: 
            \[
            \theta^* \in \arg \min_{\theta \in \mathcal{C}} \mathcal{L}(\theta): \mathbb{R}^D \to \mathbb{R}.
            \]
            Here, \(\mathcal{C}\) is the <strong>feasible set</strong> as the subset of the parameter space \(\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^D\) that 
            satisfies a set of <strong>constraints</strong>:
            \[
            \mathcal{C} = \{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^D :  h_i (\theta) = 0, i \in \mathcal{E}, \,  g_j (\theta) \leq 0,  j \in \mathcal{I} \}.
            \]
            where \(\mathcal{E}\) is a set of equality constraints and \(\mathcal{I}\) is a set of inequality constraints. 
            <br><br>
            Note: Often, we convert the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained problem by introducing <strong>penalty 
            terms</strong> that measure how much we violate each constraint and adding them to the objective function.

        <h1>Lagrange multipliers</h1>
        <blockquote>
            First, we consider a constrained optimization problem without inequality constraints. 
            <br><br>
            Assume we have only one equality constraint \(h(\theta) = 0\), where \(\theta \in \mathbb{R}^D\). For any point on the constraint surface, \(\nabla h(\theta)\) is 
            orthogonal to the constraint surface. Consider another point, \(\theta + \epsilon\), which is close enough the point \(\theta\) and 
            lies on the same constraint surface. By the firtst-order Taylor expansion around \(\theta\), 
            \[
            h(\theta + \epsilon) \approx h(\theta) + \epsilon^T \nabla h(\theta).
            \]
            Since both points are on the same constraint surface, \(\epsilon^T \nabla h(\theta) \approx 0\). So, 
            \(\nabla h(\theta)\) must be orthogonal to constraint surface.
            <br>
            Note: The vector \(\epsilon\) is parallel to the constraint surface.
            <br><br>
            We need to find \(\theta^*\) on the constraint surface such that \(\mathcal{L}(\theta)\) is minimized. Such a point must satisfy the 
            condition that \(\nabla h(\theta^*)\) is orthogonal to the constraint surface, and also \(\nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)\) must be orthogonal 
            to the surface too.
            <br>
            Since both \(\nabla h(\theta)\) and \(\nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)\) are orthogonal to the constraint surface at \(\theta^*\), they must be 
            parallel(or anti-parallel) to each other. Thus, there exists a constant(<strong>Lagrange multiplier</strong>), \(\lambda^* \in \mathbb{R}\) 
            such that 
            \[
            \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta^*) = \lambda^* \nabla h(\theta^*) \tag{1}
            \]
            and an objective(or, <strong>Lagrangian</strong>) is given by 
            \[
            L(\theta, \lambda) = \mathcal{L}(\theta) + \lambda h(\theta).
            \]
            <br>
            At a stationary point of the Lagrangian, 
            \[
            \nabla_{\theta, \lambda}  L(\theta, \lambda) = 0
            \]
            which means
            \[
            \lambda \nabla_{\theta} h(\theta) = \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta), \qquad h(\theta) = 0.
            \]
            Such a point is called a <strong>critical point</strong>, which statisfies \(h(\theta) = 0\) and Equation (1).
            <br>
            For multiple equality constraints: 
            \[
            L(\theta, \lambda) = \mathcal{L}(\theta) + \sum_{j} \lambda_j h_j(\theta).
            \]
            
        </blockquote>

        <h1>The KKT Conditions</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Next, consider the case where we have a single inequality constraint \(g(\theta) \leq 0\). We create the lower bound \(\mu g(\theta)\), where 
            \(\mu \geq 0\). So, the Lagrangian can be written as 
            \[
            L(\theta, \mu) = \mathcal{L}(\theta) + \mu g(\theta).
            \]
            For multiple inequality constraints, 
            \[
            L(\theta, \mu) = \mathcal{L}(\theta) + \sum_{i} \mu_i g_i(\theta).
            \]
            If \(g_i (\theta) = 0\), then the inequality constraint \(g_i (\theta) \leq 0\) is said to be <strong>active</strong>.
            <br><br>
            In general, for multiple inequality constraints and equality constraints, we obtain the Lagrangian:
            \[
            L(\theta, \mu, \lambda) = \mathcal{L}(\theta) + \sum_{i} \mu_i g_i(\theta) + \sum_{j} \lambda_j h_j(\theta)
            \]
            and our optimization problem becomes
            \[
            \min_{\theta} \max_{\mu \geq 0, \lambda} L(\theta, \mu, \lambda).
            \]
