            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The central idea of <strong>Fourier series</strong> is that a wide class of periodic functions can be represented 
                as an infinite sum of sine and cosine functions. This remarkable result, developed by Joseph Fourier in his 
                1822 work "Théorie analytique de la chaleur" (The Analytical Theory of Heat) while studying heat conduction, 
                has profound implications across mathematics, physics, engineering, and modern computer science.
                <br><br>
                Consider a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) that is periodic with period \(2\pi\), meaning 
                \(f(x + 2\pi) = f(x)\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\). Under suitable conditions (such as being piecewise 
                continuous), the <strong>Fourier series</strong> of \(f\) is:
                \[
                f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx) \right)
                \]
                where \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) are real coefficients called <strong>Fourier coefficients</strong>.
                <br><br>
                The constant term \(\frac{a_0}{2}\) represents the average value of the function over one period. 
                Each term in the series represents a <strong>harmonic component</strong>: the \(n\)-th term oscillates \(n\) times 
                over one period of \(f\). This decomposition reveals the <strong>frequency content</strong> of the signal—a 
                perspective that proves invaluable in both theoretical analysis and practical computation.
                <br><br>
                For a function with arbitrary period \(T = 2L\), we use the substitution \(x = \frac{\pi t}{L}\) to obtain:
                \[
                f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left(\frac{n\pi t}{L}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{n\pi t}{L}\right) \right)
                \]
                This flexibility allows us to analyze periodic phenomena with any period.
                <br><br>
                While Fourier series may seem purely theoretical, the discrete computational methods we'll explore in 
                <a href="fourier_transform.html">Part 15</a> are actively used in today's technology:
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li><strong>Audio and image compression:</strong> MP3, AAC, and JPEG use discrete cosine transforms 
                    (closely related to Fourier series) to compress data by identifying which frequency components humans 
                    are least sensitive to</li>
                    <li><strong>Speech recognition and synthesis:</strong> Modern speech AI systems (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant) 
                    use Fourier-based spectrograms to convert audio waveforms into features that neural networks can process</li>
                    <li><strong>Music information retrieval:</strong> Applications like Shazam identify songs by analyzing 
                    their frequency signatures using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)</li>
                    <li><strong>Time series forecasting:</strong> Machine learning models for financial data, weather prediction, 
                    and sensor data often use Fourier features to capture periodic patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal cycles)</li>
                </ul>
                The fundamental idea—decomposing complex signals into simple periodic components—remains at the heart of 
                how modern systems process audio, images, and temporal data. Understanding Fourier series provides the 
                mathematical foundation for these ubiquitous technologies.

            <h2>Orthogonality of Trigonometric Functions</h2>
            <p>
            The key to computing Fourier coefficients lies in the <strong>orthogonality</strong> of trigonometric functions. 
            We define an <a href="../Linear_algebra/orthogonality.html">inner product</a> on the space of functions over 
            \([-\pi, \pi]\) by:
            \[
            \langle f, g \rangle = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)g(x) \, dx
            \]
            <br>
            The trigonometric functions satisfy the following orthogonality relations:
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos(mx)\cos(nx) \, dx &= \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{if } m \neq n \\
            \pi & \text{if } m = n \neq 0 \\
            2\pi & \text{if } m = n = 0
            \end{cases} \\\\
            \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin(mx)\sin(nx) \, dx &= \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{if } m \neq n \\
            \pi & \text{if } m = n \neq 0
            \end{cases} \\\\
            \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos(mx)\sin(nx) \, dx &= 0 \quad \text{for all } m, n
            \end{align*}
            \]
            <br>
            These relations show that the set \(\{1, \cos(x), \sin(x), \cos(2x), \sin(2x), \ldots\}\) forms an 
            <strong>orthogonal basis</strong> for the space of square-integrable periodic functions on \([-\pi, \pi]\).
            <br><br>
            This orthogonality is analogous to the orthogonality of vectors in Euclidean space, but now we're working 
            in an infinite-dimensional function space. Just as we can decompose a vector into components along orthogonal 
            basis vectors, we can decompose a periodic function into components along orthogonal trigonometric functions.

            <section id="coeff" class="section-content">
            <h2>Fourier Coefficients</h2>
            <p>
            Using the orthogonality relations, we can derive formulas for the Fourier coefficients by taking inner products 
            of \(f\) with each basis function.
            <br><br>
            To find \(a_0\), integrate both sides of the Fourier series:
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \, dx &= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{a_0}{2} \, dx + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos(nx) \, dx + b_n \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin(nx) \, dx \right) \\\\
            &= \pi a_0
            \end{align*}
            \]
            Therefore:
            \[
            a_0 = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \, dx
            \]
            <br>
            To find \(a_n\) for \(n \geq 1\), multiply both sides by \(\cos(mx)\) and integrate:
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\cos(mx) \, dx &= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{a_0}{2}\cos(mx) \, dx \\\\
            &\quad + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos(nx)\cos(mx) \, dx + b_n \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin(nx)\cos(mx) \, dx \right) \\\\
            &= \pi a_m
            \end{align*}
            \]
            Therefore:
            \[
            a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\cos(nx) \, dx, \quad n \geq 1
            \]
            <br>
            Similarly, multiplying by \(\sin(mx)\) and integrating gives:
            \[
            b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\sin(nx) \, dx, \quad n \geq 1
            \]
            <br>
            These formulas allow us to compute the Fourier series representation of any suitable periodic function.
            <div class="proof">
                <span class="proof-title">Example: Square Wave</span>
                Consider the square wave function with period \(2\pi\):
                \[
                f(x) = \begin{cases}
                1 & \text{if } 0 < x < \pi \\
                -1 & \text{if } -\pi < x < 0
                \end{cases}
                \]
                <br>
                First, compute \(a_0\):
                \[
                a_0 = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\int_{-\pi}^{0} (-1) \, dx + \int_{0}^{\pi} 1 \, dx\right) = 0
                \]
                <br>
                For \(n \geq 1\):
                \[
                \begin{align*}
                a_n &= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\cos(nx) \, dx \\\\
                &= \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\int_{-\pi}^{0} (-1)\cos(nx) \, dx + \int_{0}^{\pi} \cos(nx) \, dx\right) = 0
                \end{align*}
                \]
                (The cosine terms vanish due to symmetry.)
                <br><br>
                For the sine coefficients:
                \[
                \begin{align*}
                b_n &= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\sin(nx) \, dx \\\\
                &= \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\int_{-\pi}^{0} (-1)\sin(nx) \, dx + \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(nx) \, dx\right) \\\\
                &= \frac{1}{\pi}\left[\frac{\cos(nx)}{n}\bigg|_{-\pi}^{0} - \frac{\cos(nx)}{n}\bigg|_{0}^{\pi}\right] \\\\
                &= \frac{2}{n\pi}(1 - \cos(n\pi)) = \begin{cases}
                \frac{4}{n\pi} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\
                0 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}
                \end{cases}
                \end{align*}
                \]
                <br>
                Therefore, the Fourier series is:
                \[
                f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin((2k+1)x)}{2k+1} = \frac{4}{\pi}\left(\sin(x) + \frac{\sin(3x)}{3} + \frac{\sin(5x)}{5} + \cdots\right)
                \]

            <h2>Complex Exponential Form</h2>
            <p>
            Using <strong>Euler's formula</strong>:
            \[
            e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)
            \]
            we can write:
            \[
            \cos(nx) = \frac{e^{inx} + e^{-inx}}{2}, \quad \sin(nx) = \frac{e^{inx} - e^{-inx}}{2i}
            \]
            <br>
            Substituting these into the Fourier series and combining terms, we obtain the <strong>complex exponential form</strong>:
            \[
            f(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n e^{inx}
            \]
            where the complex Fourier coefficients are:
            \[
            c_n = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)e^{-inx} \, dx
            \]
            <br>
            The relationship between the real and complex coefficients is:
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            c_0 &= \frac{a_0}{2} \\\\
            c_n &= \frac{a_n - ib_n}{2}, \quad n > 0 \\\\
            c_n &= \frac{a_{-n} + ib_{-n}}{2} = \overline{c_{-n}}, \quad n < 0
            \end{align*}
            \]
            <br>
            The complex form is often more convenient for theoretical work and connects naturally to the Fourier transform. 
            The set \(\{e^{inx}\}_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\) forms an orthonormal basis with respect to the inner product:
            \[
            \langle f, g \rangle = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\overline{g(x)} \, dx
            \]
            where \(\overline{g(x)}\) denotes the complex conjugate of \(g(x)\).

            <h2>Parseval's Identity</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>Parseval's identity</strong> (also called <strong>Parseval's theorem</strong>) relates the total energy 
            of a signal in the time domain to its energy in the frequency domain. For a function \(f\) with Fourier series 
            coefficients \(a_n\) and \(b_n\), it states:
            \[
            \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \frac{a_0^2}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (a_n^2 + b_n^2)
            \]
            <br>
            In the complex exponential form, this becomes:
            \[
            \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} |c_n|^2
            \]
            <br>
            This identity is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to infinite-dimensional function spaces. 
            The left side represents the "energy" or total power of the signal, while the right side shows that 
            this energy is distributed across the frequency components.
            <br><br>
            Parseval's identity has important applications in signal processing, where it guarantees that no energy is 
            lost or gained when transforming between time and frequency representations. This conservation principle 
            is fundamental to understanding how signals behave under Fourier analysis.

                Starting from the Fourier series representation:
                \[
                \begin{align*}
                \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} |f(x)|^2 \, dx &= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \cdot \overline{f(x)} \, dx \\\\
                &= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \left(\frac{\overline{a_0}}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\overline{a_n}\cos(nx) + \overline{b_n}\sin(nx))\right) dx
                \end{align*}
                \]
                Using the orthogonality relations and the formulas for Fourier coefficients:
                \[
                = \frac{a_0^2}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (a_n^2 + b_n^2)
                \]

            <h2>Convergence Properties</h2>
            <p>
            A fundamental question in Fourier analysis is: when does the Fourier series actually converge to the function \(f\)? 
            Several types of convergence are relevant:
            <br><br>
            <strong>1. Pointwise Convergence:</strong>
            <br>
            Under suitable conditions (such as \(f\) being piecewise smooth), the Fourier series converges pointwise to \(f(x)\) 
            at points of continuity, and to the average \(\frac{f(x^+) + f(x^-)}{2}\) at jump discontinuities.
            <br><br>
            <strong>2. Mean Square (L² ) Convergence:</strong>
            <br>
            For any square-integrable function \(f\) (i.e., \(\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} |f(x)|^2 \, dx < \infty\)), the Fourier series 
            converges in the mean square sense:
            \[
            \lim_{N \to \infty} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \left|f(x) - \left(\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} (a_n\cos(nx) + b_n\sin(nx))\right)\right|^2 dx = 0
            \]
            This is guaranteed by the completeness of the trigonometric system in \(L^2[-\pi, \pi]\).
            <br><br>
            <strong>3. The Gibbs Phenomenon:</strong>
            <br>
            At jump discontinuities, the partial sums of the Fourier series exhibit oscillations that overshoot the true function 
            value by approximately 9% of the jump size. This overshoot does not disappear as more terms are added; instead, it 
            becomes more concentrated near the discontinuity. This is known as the <strong>Gibbs phenomenon</strong>, named 
            after physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs.
            <br><br>
            For the square wave example, near the discontinuity at \(x = 0\), the partial sum oscillates between approximately 
            \(-1.09\) and \(1.09\), even though the function only takes values \(\pm 1\). As \(N \to \infty\), these oscillations 
            compress toward the discontinuity but maintain their amplitude.
            <br><br>
            <strong>4. Uniform Convergence:</strong>
            <br>
            If \(f\) is continuous and piecewise smooth, and its derivative is also square-integrable, then the Fourier series 
            converges uniformly to \(f\). This stronger form of convergence is important for applications where we need guarantees 
            about approximation quality at every point simultaneously.
            <br><br>
            The connection to <a href="lebesgue.html">Lebesgue integration</a> is crucial here: the L² convergence result 
            is most naturally stated and proved using Lebesgue integration theory, which provides the proper framework for 
            understanding function spaces and convergence in modern analysis.
