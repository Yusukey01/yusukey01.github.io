        <h1>Probability Space</h1>
        <blockquote>
            In the previous section, we found out that some functions cannot be integrable using either the Riemann or improper 
            Riemann integration. To handle such cases, we need to introduce <strong>measure theory</strong> and the <strong>Lebesgue integralation</strong>. 
            Since our focus is on applied mathematics, particularly in the context of statistics and machine learning, we will concentrate 
            on probability-related measure theory. While we'll avoid covering every foundational topic and formal mathematical 
            detail, our goal is to build a solid understanding that leads to the introduction of the Lebesgue integration.
            <br><br>
            First, we need a formal definition of probalistic model:
            <br><br>
            A <strong>probability space</strong> is a triple \(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P}\) where 
            <ul>
                <li>\(\Omega\) is the <strong>sample space</strong>:</li>
                    The set of possible outcomes of an experiment.
                <li>\(\mathcal{F}\) is a <strong>\(\sigma\)-algebra</strong>:</li>
                    A collection of of subsets of the sample space \(\Omega\).
                <li>\(\mathbb{P}\) is a <strong>probability measure</strong>:</li>
                    A function that assigns a nonnegative probability to every set in the \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{F}\).
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <h1>Sample Space</h1>
        <blockquote>
            The sample space \(\Omega\) can be finite, countable, or uncountable. An element of \(\Omega\) is denoted by 
            \(\omega\), and is called an <strong>elementary outcomes</strong>. 
            <br><br>
            For example, if our experiment consists of an infinite number of consecutive rolls of a die, the sample space is the set:
            \[
            \Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}^{\infty}
            \]
            and an elementary outcome is an infinite sequence such as: 
            \[
            \omega =  \{1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 5, \cdots\}.
            \]
            <br>
            A simpler case of the probability space can be a <strong>discrete probability space</strong>. In this case, the sample space 
            is finite, or countable:
            \[
            \Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \cdots \}.
            \]
            and \(\sigma\)-algebra is the set of all subsets of \(\Omega\). Then the probability measure assigns a number in the set \([0, 1]\) to 
            every subset of \(\Omega\). It is defined in terms of the probabilities \(\mathbb{P}(\{\omega\})\) of the elementary outcomes and satisfies
            \[
            \forall A \subset \Omega, \quad P(A) = \sum_{\omega \in A}\mathbb{P}(\{\omega\})
            \]
            and
            \[
            \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}\mathbb{P}(\{\omega\}) = 1.
            \]
            Note: We will use \(\mathbb{P}(\omega)\) instead of \(\mathbb{P}(\{\omega\})\) and  \(\mathbb{P}(\omega_i)\) will be denoted by \(p_i\).

        <h1>\(\sigma\)-algebra</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Ideally, we want to specify the probability \(\mathbb{P} (A)\) of "every" subset of \(\Omega\).  However, it 
            is too complicated, especially, in the case where \(\Omega\) is uncountable. So, we assign probabilities to only 
            a partial collection of subsets of \(\Omega\). The sets in this collection are to be thought of as the “nice” 
            and "interesting" subsets of \(\Omega\). Formally, we define the collection as follows:
            <br><br>
            <strong>\(\sigma\)-algebra</strong>, \(\mathcal{F}\) is a collection of subsets of \(\Omega\) with the following properties:
            <ol>
                <li>\(\mathcal{\emptyset} \in \mathcal{F}\).</li>
                <li>If \(A \in \mathcal{F}\), then \(A^c \in \mathcal{F}\).</li>
                <li>If \(\forall i \in \mathbb{N}, A_i \in \mathcal{F}\), then \(\bigcup_{i =1}^{\infty} A_i \in \mathcal{F}\).</li>
            </ol>
            An <strong>event</strong> \(A\) is called an <strong>\(\mathcal{F}\)-measurable set</strong>, or simply a measurable set. The pair 
            \((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\) is called a <strong>measurable space</strong>.
