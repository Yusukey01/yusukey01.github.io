        <h1>Probability Space</h1>
        <blockquote>
            In the previous section, we found out that some functions cannot be integrable using either the Riemann or improper 
            Riemann integration. To handle such cases, we need to introduce <strong>measure theory</strong> and the <strong>Lebesgue integralation</strong>. 
            Since our focus is on applied mathematics, particularly in the context of statistics and machine learning, we will concentrate 
            on probability-related measure theory. While we'll avoid covering every foundational topic and formal mathematical 
            detail, our goal is to build a solid understanding that leads to the introduction of the Lebesgue integration.
            <br><br>
            First, we need a formal definition of probalistic model:
            <br><br>
            A <strong>probability space</strong> is a triple \(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P}\) where 
            <ul>
                <li>\(\Omega\) is the <strong>sample space</strong>:</li>
                    The set of possible outcomes of an experiment.
                <li>\(\mathcal{F}\) is a <strong>\(\sigma\)-algebra:</strong>:</li>
                    A collection of of subsets of the sample space \(\Omega\).
                <li>\(\mathbb{P}\) is a <strong>probability measure</strong>:</li>
                    A function that assigns a nonnegative probability to every set in the \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{F}\).
            </ul>
