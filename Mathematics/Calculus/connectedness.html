                <p>
                    A metric space is <strong>connected</strong> if it cannot be split into two disjoint non-empty 
                    open sets. Intuitively, a connected space is "all in one piece"—you cannot separate it into 
                    isolated regions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why does this matter? In optimization, connectedness ensures that we can move continuously from 
                    any point to any other point within the feasible region. If the feasible set were disconnected, 
                    an optimization algorithm starting in one component could never reach a better solution in another 
                    component via a continuous path.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Connectedness is also foundational for <strong>manifolds</strong>. A manifold is typically required 
                    to be connected (or we study its connected components separately). Path-connectedness—a stronger 
                    property—ensures we can always draw a continuous curve between any two points, which is essential 
                    for defining concepts like geodesics.

                        paths on manifolds become curves, and the study of shortest paths leads to geodesics—central
