                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Continuity</strong> is one of the most fundamental concepts in analysis because continuity 
                    let us transfer properties such as connectivity and compactness from domain to range. In calculus, 
                    you learned that a function is continuous if "small changes in input produce small changes in output." 
                    With our metric space framework, we can now make this precise and extend it to functions between 
                    arbitrary metric spaces, not just subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why does this matter for machine learning and optimization? Neural networks are compositions 
                    of continuous functions. The loss landscape we navigate during training is (usually) continuous. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    But not all notions of continuity are equal. <strong>Uniform</strong> continuity provides stronger 
                    guarantees, and <strong>Lipschitz</strong> continuity, which bounds how fast a function can change is 
                    essential for proving convergence rates of optimization algorithms.

                    First, we would like to generalize \(\epsilon - \delta\) continuity to metric spaces.

                    <strong>continuous</strong> at \(z\) in \(X\) if and only if for each open subset \(V\) of \(Y\) 
                    with \(f(z) \in V\), there exists an open subset \(U\) of \(X\) with \(z \in U\) such that 
                    \(f(U) \subseteq V\).

                    Suppose \(U\) is an open subset of \(Z\). Then \(U \cap f(X)\) is open in \((f(X), e)\) because 
                    \(Z\) is a metric superspace of \((f(X), e)\), and \(U \cap f(X) = W \cap f(X) \) fpr some open 
                    subset \(W\) of \((Y, e)\) because \((f(X), e)\) is metric subspace of \((Y, e)\). Thus,
                    \[
                    \being{align*}
                    f^{-1}(U) &= f^{-1}(U \cap f(X)) \\\\

                    \(f: X \to Z\) is also continuous.

                    Similarly, it is clear that compositions preserve continuity.

                   are continuous, then \(g \circ f\) is continuous.
