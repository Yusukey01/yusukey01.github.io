                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Continuity</strong> is one of the most fundamental concepts in analysis because it allows us to 
                    transfer properties such as connectivity and compactness from the domain to the range. In calculus, 
                    you learned that a function is continuous if "small changes in input produce small changes in output." 
                    With our metric space framework, we can now make this precise and extend it to functions between 
                    arbitrary metric spaces, not just subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why does this matter for machine learning and optimization? 
                    Neural networks are essentially compositions of continuous functions (linear layers and non-linear activations). 
                    The "loss landscape" we navigate during training relies on continuity to ensure that we can essentially "slide down" 
                    to a minimum. Without continuity, optimization methods like Gradient Descent would be fundamentally broken.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But not all notions of continuity are equal. 
                    <strong>Uniform continuity</strong> provides stronger global guarantees, and 
                    <strong>Lipschitz continuity</strong>, which bounds how fast a function can change is 
                    essential for guaranteeing the convergence speed of these algorithms.

                <h2>Continuity</h2>
                
                <p>
                    In calculus, continuity is often taught as "no breaks in the graph." However, in the rigorous language of 
                    modern analysis, continuity is about <strong>preserving structure</strong>. It ensures that "nearness" in the 
                    domain translates to "nearness" in the range, without tearing the space apart.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We define continuity using the concept of <strong>open sets</strong> (neighborhoods). This structural definition is 
                    superior because it captures the essence of topology without relying on specific distance calculations.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Continuous Function</span>
                    Suppose \(X\) and \(Y\) are metric spaces, \(z \in X\) and \(f: X \to Y\). We say that \(f\) is 
                    <strong>continuous</strong> at \(z\) in \(X\) if and only if for each open subset \(V\) of \(Y\) 
                    with \(f(z) \in V\), there exists an open subset \(U\) of \(X\) with \(z \in U\) such that 
                    \[
                    f(U) \subseteq V.
                    \]
                    If \(f\) is continuous at every point \(z \in X\), we say \(f\) is <strong>continuous on \(X\)</strong>.

                    <p>
                        This definition says: "If you define a target neighborhood \(V\) around the output \(f(z)\), 
                        I can always find a source neighborhood \(U\) around the input \(z\) that lands entirely within your target."
                        This guarantees that the function does not "tear" the space or make abrupt jumps.

                <p>
                    While the open set definition gives us the structural view, in practical optimization we often need to 
                    compute bounds using distances. In metric spaces, the structural definition is logically equivalent to 
                    the familiar \(\epsilon\)-\(\delta\) formulation.

                    Let \((X, d)\) and \((Y, e)\) be metric spaces. A function \(f: X \to Y\) is continuous at \(z\) 
                    (in the sense of the definition above) if and only if:
                    <br>
                    For every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists \(\delta > 0\) such that

                    d(x, z) < \delta \implies e(f(x), f(z)) < \epsilon.

                <p>
                    The power of the open-set definition becomes clear when we look at global properties. 
                    Continuity allows us to pull topological structures back from the range to the domain.

                    Suppose \(U\) is an open subset of \(Z\). Then \(U \cap f(X)\) is open in \((f(X), e)\) because \(Z\) is a

                    which is open in \(X\) because \(f: X \to Y\) is a continuous function. Since \(U\) was an arbitrary open subset

                    <p>
                        In deep learning, continuity is a prerequisite for <strong>robustness</strong>. 
                        It implies that if an input image \(x\) is perturbed slightly (noise), the model's prediction \(f(x)\) 
                        should not jump abruptly. However, mere continuity allows the function to change arbitrarily fast locally. 
                        This loophole is exploited by <strong>Adversarial Attacks</strong>, where imperceptible noise causes a 
                        continuous but unstable model to misclassify data with high confidence.

                    Standard continuity is a <strong>local</strong> property. It only guarantees that for each point \(z\), there is a \(\delta\) 
                    that works for its immediate neighborhood. But as we move across the domain, this \(\delta\) might need to become 
                    infinitely small to keep the output change within \(\epsilon\).

                    <strong>Lipschitz continuity</strong>. Unlike uniform continuity which only says "steepness is bounded locally," 
                    Lipschitz continuity gives us a concrete number, the <strong>Lipschitz constant</strong>, that bounds the rate

                    <strong>Terminology Note:</strong><br>
                    In our curriculum's structural hierarchy, we use <strong>Contraction</strong> for \(k \le 1\) and <strong>Strong Contraction</strong> for \(k < 1\). 
                    Please note that in many other standard texts, the word "Contraction" is used exclusively for the \(k < 1\) case, 
                    while the \(k \le 1\) case is referred to as <strong>Non-expansive</strong>. We provide this distinction to better visualize the "rigidity" 
                    of mappings before introducing fixed-point theorems.

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Strong Contraction</span>
                    A map \(f: X \to X\) is a <strong>strong contraction</strong> if there exists \(L \in [0, 1)\) such that:
                    \[
                    d(f(x), f(z)) \leq L \cdot d(x, z) \quad \forall x, z \in X.
                    \]
                    Immediately, a strong contraction is a Lipschitz function with \(L < 1\) and is uniformly continuous on its domain. 
                    We will use this property later when we discuss <strong>completeness</strong>.

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Isometry</span>
                    A map \(\phi: X \to Y\) is called an <strong>isometry</strong> if and only if it preserves distances exactly:
                    \[
                    e(\phi(a), \phi(b)) = d(a, b) \quad \forall a, b \in X.
                    \]
                    Note: Every isometry is a contraction with \(L = 1\), but a Lipschitz function with \(L = 1\) is not necessarily an isometry.

                    <h3>Insight: Why Hierarchy of Continuity Matters</h3>
                    <p>
                        In machine learning and optimization, we don't just want functions to be continuous; 
                        we want to understand how "well-behaved" they are. This hierarchy acts as a set of guardrails:

                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> The bare minimum for Gradient Descent to "slide" on a loss landscape without jumps.</li>
                        <li><strong>Uniform Continuity:</strong> Ensures that a fixed step size won't lead to unpredictable behavior just because we moved to a different region of the space.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lipschitz Continuity:</strong> The gold standard. It provides a concrete limit on "steepness," ensuring stability during training.</li>

                            <strong>Convergence Rates:</strong><br>
                            In convex optimization, if the gradient is \(L\)-Lipschitz (called \(L\)-smooth), 
                            gradient descent is guaranteed to converge at a rate of \(O(1/T)\). The constant \(L\) determines the maximum safe learning rate (\(\eta < 2/L\)).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>GAN Stability:</strong><br>
                            In Wasserstein GANs (WGAN), the theoretical framework requires the discriminator (critic) to be 1-Lipschitz. 
                            Techniques like <strong>Gradient Penalty</strong> or <strong>Spectral Normalization</strong> are explicitly designed to enforce this.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Fixed Point Iterations:</strong><br>
                            <strong>Strong contractions</strong> guarantee a unique fixed point (Banach Fixed Point Theorem). 
                            This is why the Bellman Operator in Reinforcement Learning converges to the optimal value function.
