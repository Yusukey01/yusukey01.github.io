                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Continuity is one of the most fundamental concepts in analysis. In calculus, you learned that 
                    a function is continuous if "small changes in input produce small changes in output." With our 
                    metric space framework, we can now make this precise—and extend it to functions between 
                    arbitrary metric spaces, not just subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why does this matter for machine learning and optimization? Neural networks are compositions 
                    of continuous functions. The loss landscape we navigate during training is (usually) continuous. 
                    Continuity ensures that gradient descent doesn't "jump" unpredictably—nearby parameter values 
                    yield nearby loss values.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But not all notions of continuity are equal. <em>Uniform</em> continuity provides stronger 
                    guarantees, and <em>Lipschitz</em> continuity—which bounds how fast a function can change—is 
                    essential for proving convergence rates of optimization algorithms.
