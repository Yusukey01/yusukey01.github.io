                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Continuity</strong> is one of the most fundamental concepts in analysis because it allows us to 
                    transfer properties such as connectivity and compactness from the domain to the range. In calculus, 
                    you learned that a function is continuous if "small changes in input produce small changes in output." 
                    With our metric space framework, we can now make this precise and extend it to functions between 
                    arbitrary metric spaces, not just subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why does this matter for machine learning and optimization? 
                    Neural networks are essentially compositions of continuous functions (linear layers and non-linear activations). 
                    The "loss landscape" we navigate during training relies on continuity to ensure that we can essentially "slide down" 
                    to a minimum. Without continuity, optimization methods like Gradient Descent would be fundamentally broken.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But not all notions of continuity are equal. 
                    <strong>Uniform continuity</strong> provides stronger global guarantees, and 
                    <strong>Lipschitz continuity</strong>, which bounds how fast a function can change is 
                    essential for guaranteeing the convergence speed of these algorithms.

                <h2>Continuity</h2>
                
                <p>
                    In calculus, continuity is often taught as "no breaks in the graph." However, in the rigorous language of 
                    modern analysis, continuity is about <strong>preserving structure</strong>. It ensures that "nearness" in the 
                    domain translates to "nearness" in the range, without tearing the space apart.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We define continuity using the concept of <strong>open sets</strong> (neighborhoods). This structural definition is 
                    superior because it captures the essence of topology without relying on specific distance calculations.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    <span class="theorem-title">Definition: Continuous Function</span>
                    Suppose \(X\) and \(Y\) are metric spaces, \(z \in X\) and \(f: X \to Y\). We say that \(f\) is 
                    <strong>continuous</strong> at \(z\) in \(X\) if and only if for each open subset \(V\) of \(Y\) 
                    with \(f(z) \in V\), there exists an open subset \(U\) of \(X\) with \(z \in U\) such that 
                    \[
                    f(U) \subseteq V.
                    \]
                    If \(f\) is continuous at every point \(z \in X\), we say \(f\) is <strong>continuous on \(X\)</strong>.

                    <p>
                        This definition says: "If you define a target neighborhood \(V\) around the output \(f(z)\), 
                        I can always find a source neighborhood \(U\) around the input \(z\) that lands entirely within your target."
                        This guarantees that the function does not "tear" the space or make abrupt jumps.

                <p>
                    While the open-set definition gives us the structural view, in practical optimization we often need to 
                    compute bounds using distances. In metric spaces, the structural definition is logically equivalent to 
                    the familiar \(\epsilon-\delta\) formulation.

                    Let \((X, d)\) and \((Y, e)\) be metric spaces. A function \(f: X \to Y\) is continuous at \(z\) 
                    (in the sense of the definition above) if and only if:
                    <br>
                    For every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists \(\delta > 0\) such that
                    \[
                    d(x, z) < \delta \implies e(f(x), f(z)) < \epsilon.

                <p>
                    The power of the open-set definition becomes clear when we look at global properties. 
                    Continuity allows us to pull topological structures back from the range to the domain.

                <p>
                    Using this topological definition, it becomes straightforward to show that continuity is preserved

                    which is open in \(X\) because \(f: X \to Y\) is continuous. Since \(U\) is any open subset of \(Z\), this implies

                    <p>
                        In deep learning, continuity is a prerequisite for <strong>robustness</strong>. 
                        It implies that if an input image \(x\) is perturbed slightly (noise), the model's prediction \(f(x)\) 
                        should not jump abruptly. However, mere continuity allows the function to change arbitrarily fast locally. 
                        This loophole is exploited by <strong>Adversarial Attacks</strong>, where imperceptible noise causes a 
                        continuous but unstable model to misclassify data with high confidence.

                    In standard continuity, the \(\delta\) depends on both \(\epsilon\) and the point \(z\). 
                    This means a function could get infinitely steep in some regions (like \(f(x) = 1/x\) near 0), requiring 
                    an infinitely small \(\delta\). 
                    <strong>Uniform continuity</strong> demands a single \(\delta\) that works for the entire domain.

                    <p>
                        Consider gradient descent with a fixed learning rate (step size). 
                        If the loss function is <strong>not</strong> uniformly continuous, its steepness could change 
                        drastically across the landscape. A step size that is safe in a flat region might cause the 
                        algorithm to diverge (explode) in a steep region. Uniform continuity ensures that the function's 
                        behavior is consistent enough that a "safe" step size exists globally.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    An important fact (the Heine-Cantor theorem) is that any continuous function is uniformly continuous 
                    on all <strong>compact</strong> subsets of its domain. While we will discuss compactness in depth later, 
                    for the context of optimization, the following working definition is particularly useful:

                    If the Lipschitz constant is \(k \le 1\), the function is called <strong>non-expansive</strong> (it does not stretch distances).

                            <strong>Convergence Rates:</strong><br>
                            In convex optimization, if the gradient is \(L\)-Lipschitz (called \(L\)-smooth), 
                            gradient descent is guaranteed to converge at a rate of \(O(1/T)\). The constant \(L\) determines the maximum safe learning rate (\(\eta < 2/L\)).

                        <li>
                            <strong>GAN Stability:</strong><br>
                            In Wasserstein GANs (WGAN), the theoretical framework requires the discriminator (critic) to be 1-Lipschitz. 
                            Techniques like <strong>Gradient Penalty</strong> or <strong>Spectral Normalization</strong> are explicitly designed to enforce this constraint.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Fixed Point Iterations:</strong><br>
                            Strong contractions guarantee a unique fixed point (Banach Fixed Point Theorem). 
                            This is why the Bellman Operator in Reinforcement Learning converges to the optimal value function.
