                <h2>Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)</h2>
                <p> 
                    The key idea of <strong>deep neural networks (DNNs)</strong> is "composing" a vast number of simple functions to 
                    make a huge complex function. In this section, we focus on a specific type of DNN known as the <strong>multilayer perceptron (MLP)</strong>, 
                    also referred to as a <strong>feedforward neural network (FFNN)</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An MLP defines a composite function of the form: 
                    \[
                    f(x ; \theta) = f_L (f_{L-1}(\cdots(f_1(x))\cdots))
                    \]
                
                    where each component function \( f_\ell(x) = f(x; \theta_\ell) \) represents the transformation at 
                    <strong>layer</strong> \( \ell \,\), \( x \in \mathbb{R}^D \) is an input vector with \( D \) features, and 
                    \(\theta\) is a collection of parameters(weights and biases):
                    \[
                    \theta = \{ \theta_\ell \}_{\ell=1}^L \text{ ,where } \theta_\ell = \{ W^{(\ell)}, b^{(\ell)} \}.
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>
                     Each layer is assumed to be <strong>differentiable</strong> and consists of two operations: an <strong>affine transformation</strong> followed 
                     by a <strong>non-linear differentiable activation function</strong> \( g_\ell : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\). An MLP consists of an <strong>input layer</strong>, 
                     one or more <strong>hidden layers</strong>, and an <strong>output layer</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We define the hidden units \(z^{(\ell)}\) at each layer \(\ell\) passed  elementwise through the activation:
                    \[
                    z^{(\ell)} = g_{\ell}(b^{(\ell)} + W^{(\ell)}z^{(\ell -1)}) = g_{\ell}(a^{(\ell)})
                    \]
                    where \(a^{(\ell)}\) is called the <strong>pre-activations</strong>, and the output of the newtwork is denoted by 
                    \(\hat{y} = h_\theta(x) = g_L(a^{(L)})\).
                </p>

                 <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Input data is typically stored as an \( N \times D \) <strong>design matrix</strong>, where each 
                    row corresponds to a data point and each column to a feature. This is referred to as <strong>structured data</strong> or 
                    <strong>tabular data</strong>. In contrast, for <strong>unstructured data</strong> such as images or text, different architectures 
                    are used:
                </p>

                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong> for images</li>
                    <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong> and <strong>Transformers</strong> for sequential data (e.g. text)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In particular, modern <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> such as GPT are based on the transformer architecture and 
                    have replaced RNNs in many natural language processing tasks.

                <h2>Activation Functions</h2>
                <p>
                    Without a <strong>non-linear</strong> activation function, a neural network composed of multiple layers would reduce to a 
                    single linear transformation:
                    \[
                    f(x ; \theta) = \theta^{(L)} \theta^{(L-1)}  \cdots \theta^{(2)} \theta^{(1)} x.
                    \]
                    This composition is still <strong>linear</strong> in \( x \), and therefore incapable of representing non-linear decision boundaries. 
                    Non-linear activation functions are necessary to break this linearity and allow networks to approximate arbitrary functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, a common choice was the <strong>sigmoid (logistic)</strong> activation function:
                    \[
                    \sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-a}}.
                    \]
                    However, sigmoid functions saturate for large positive or negative inputs: \( \sigma(a) \to 1 \) as \( a \to +\infty \), and \( \sigma(a) \to 0 \) as \( a \to -\infty \). . 
                    In these regions, the gradient becomes very small, leading to the <strong>vanishing gradient problem</strong> â€” gradients shrink as they propagate backward, making learning 
                    slow or unstable in deep networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To address this, modern networks often use the <strong>Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)</strong>:
                    \[
                    g(a) = \max(0, a) = a \mathbb{I}(a>0)
                    \]
                    ReLU introduces non-linearity while preserving gradient magnitude for positive inputs. It is computationally simple and helps maintain gradient flow during training, which 
                    is why it is now a standard choice in modern neural networks architectures.

                <p> 
                    Training the network is finding parameters \( \theta = \{ \theta_\ell \}_{\ell=1}^L \), where 
                    \( \theta_\ell = \{ W^{(\ell)}, b^{(\ell)} \} \) that minimize a loss function \(\mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y})\), which 
                    measures the discrepancy between a prediction and the true label. Common choices include:
                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li><strong>Binary cross-entropy</strong> (for binary classification): \( \mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y}) = -y \log(\hat{y}) - (1-y) \log(1-\hat{y}) \)</li>
                    <li><strong>Categorical cross-entropy</strong> (for multi-class): \( \mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y}) = -\sum_c y_c \log(\hat{y}_c) \)</li>
                    <li><strong>Mean squared error</strong> (for regression): \( \mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y}) = \|y - \hat{y}\|^2 \)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The optimization is done by performing a gradient-based optimizatiom method such as 
                    <a href="../Calculus/gradient.html"><strong>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</strong></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our demo employs <strong>mini-batch gradient descent</strong>, which computes gradients on a small random subset of the data at 
                    each iteration. This provides a good balance between computational efficiency and gradient quality, often leading to faster convergence 
                    and better generalization compared to using the entire dataset at once.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The gradients are computed efficiently by the <a href="../Calculus/jacobian.html"><strong>backpropagation</strong></a> 
                    algorithm. Backprop is an efficient application of the chain rule starting from the gradient of the loss w.r.t the 
                    output and working backwards. The algorithm computes all gradients in just two passes through the network:
