                    <p>
                    <a href="../Probability/covariance.html"><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong></a> is one of the most fundamental 
                    techniques in machine learning and statistics for <strong>dimensionality reduction</strong>. It provides a method to reduce the number of 
                    variables in high-dimensional datasets while retaining the most meaningful structure and variation present in the original data.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    PCA begins by analyzing the <strong>covariance structure</strong> of the data. Given a dataset, we compute the covariance matrix to 
                    understand how different features co-vary. Since the covariance matrix is always symmetric and positive semi-definite, it can be 
                    <a href="../Linear_algebra/symmetry.html"><strong>orthogonally diagonalized</strong></a>. The resulting eigenvectors, called 
                    <strong>principal components (PCs)</strong>, form an orthonormal basis that captures the directions of maximum variance. The corresponding 
                    eigenvalues indicate how much of the total variance is captured by each component.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    By projecting the data onto the subspace spanned by the top \(k\) principal components (those associated with the largest eigenvalues), PCA 
                    identifies a lower-dimensional representation that retains as much variance as possible. This allows us to reduce dimensionality by discarding 
                    less informative directions (i.e., those with small variance), thereby simplifying the dataset while minimizing information loss.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    For example, if a dataset in \(\mathbb{R}^{10}\) has 3 principal components capturing 95% of the total variance, we can project the original data onto a 
                    3D subspace. This projection preserves the dominant patterns and relationships in the data and filters out noise and redundancy. The transformed vectors 
                    in the low-dimensional space are known as <strong>latent representations</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    While PCA is a powerful tool, it identifies directions of maximum variance using <strong>linear combinations</strong> of the 
                    original features. As a result, it may fail to uncover complex, <em>nonlinear</em> structures in the data.

                <h2>Kernel PCA</h2>
                <p> 
                    Given the \(N \times D\) data matrix. PCA is a problem of determining the eigenvectors of the \(D\times D\) 
                    covariance matrix \(X^\top X\). If \(D >> N\), working with the \(N \times N\) <strong>Gram matrix</strong> 
                    \(K = XX^\top\) is much efficient. The Gram matrix is just a matrix of inner products \(x_i^\top x_j\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Kernel PCA (KPCA)</strong> is a nonlinear generalization of classical PCA that uses the 
                    <a href="intro_classification.html"><strong>kernel trick</strong></a>, which allows us to replace 
                    inner products \(x_i^\top x_j\) with a kernel function \(K_{ij} = \mathcal{K}(x_i, x_j)\).
                </p>

                <p>   
                    The kPCA implicitly replaces \(x_i\) with \(\phi(x_i) = \phi_i\). Let \(\Phi\) be the corresponding 
                    design matrix.
                    Assuming the features are centered, the covariance matrix in feature space is represented by:
                    \[
                    S_{\phi} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \phi_i \phi_i^T.
                    \]
                    The normalized eigenvectors of \(S\) are give by:
                    \[
                    V_{kPCA} = \Phi^\top U \Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}
                    \]
                    where \(U\) is an orthogonal matrix containing the eigenvectors of the Gramm matrix \(K = XX^\top\) with 
                    corresponding eigenvalues in \(\Lambda\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since \(\phi_i\) can be infinite dimensional, we cannot compute \(V_{kPCA}\). Instead, we compute the projection 
                    of a test vector \(x_*\) onto the feature space:
                    \[
                    \phi_*^\top V_{kPCA} = \phi_*^\top \Phi^\top U \Lambda^{1\frac{1}{2}} = k_*^\top U \Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}
                    \]
                    where \(k_* = \left[\mathcal{K}(x_* , x_1), \cdots, \mathcal{K}(x_* , x_N) \right]\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that using \(K = \Phi \Phi^\top\) is valid only if \(\mathbb{E}[\phi_i] = 0\). However, the feature space can be 
                    infinite dimensional, so we cannot subtract off the mean. Here, we introduce the <strong>double centering trick</strong>. 
                    Let the centered feature vector be 
                    \[
                    \tilde{\phi}_i = \phi(x_i) - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j =1}^N \phi(x_j).
                    \]
                    Its Gram matrix is give by
                    \[
                    \tilde{K}_{ij} =  \tilde{\phi}_i^\top \tilde{\phi}_j.
                    \]
                    By the double centering trick, 
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    \tilde{K} &= C_N K C_N  \\\\
                              &= K - \frac{1}{N}JK - \frac{1}{N}KJ + \frac{1}{N^2}1^\top K 1
                     \end{align*}
                    \]
                    where 
                    \[
                    C_N = I_N - \frac{1}{N}1_N 1_N^\top
                    \]
                    is the centering matrix. 
                    <br>
                    Note: \(J\) denotes the \(N \times N\) all-ones matrix: \(J = 1_N 1_N^\top\).
                </p>
                <div class="proof">
                Note: To verify the double centering trick, consider the scalar form:
                \[
                \begin{align*}
                \tilde{K}_{ij} &= \tilde{x}_i^\top \tilde{x}_j \\\\
                                &= \left(x_i - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^N x_k \right)\left(x_j - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{l=1}^N x_l \right) \\\\
                                &= x_i^\top x_j - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{l=1}^N x_i^\top x_l - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{l=1}^N x_j^\top x_k 
                                    + \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{k=1}^N \sum_{l =1}^N x_k^\top x_l.
                \end{align*}
                \]

                 <p>
                    <strong>Data reconstruction</strong> serves as the primary quality control mechanism for dimensionality reduction. 
                    When we compress data from the original high-dimensional feature space \(\mathbb{R}^D\) to low-dimensional space 
                    \(\mathbb{R}^L\) (where \(L < D\)), we need to ensure that the essential structure and information of the original 
                    data is preserved. The reconstruction error provides a quantitative measure of information loss. If reconstruction is poor, 
                    the learned representation is inadequate for the task at hand.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    Reconstruction ensures that the learned latent representation \(z = f_e(x)\) captures the 
                    most relevant and meaningful features of the data. The fuction \(f_e : x \to z\) is called 
                    the <strong>encoder</strong>. If the <strong>decoder</strong> \(f_d : z \to x\) 
                    can successfully reconstruct the original input \(x\) from \(z\), it demonstrates that \(z\) contains 
                    sufficient information about the underlying data structure.
                 </p>

                <p>
                    We can consider PCA as the process of learning linear mappings such as \(f_e\) and \(f_d\). 
                    Then the <strong>reconstruction function</strong> can be represented as \(r(x) = f_d \left(f_e(x) \right)\), 
                    which is trained to minimize \(\mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\log p(x | r(x))\). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can implement \(f_e\) and \(f_e\) by <strong>neural networks</strong>. This is called <strong>autoencoder</strong>. 
                    Especially, A linear autoencoder is equivalent to PCA:
                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>Input: \(x \in \mathbb{R}^D\)</li>
                        <li>Hidden units: \(z = W_1 x, \quad W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times D}, \quad L < D\) </li>
                        <li>Output: \(\hat{x} = W_2 z = W_2 W_1 x = Wx, \quad W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times L}\)</li>
                    </ul>
                    This model is trained by minimizing the squared reconstruction error: 
                    \[
                    \mathcal{L}(W) = \sum_{n=1}^N \| x_n - W x_n\|_2^2 
                    \]
                    Then we obtain \(\hat{W}\), an orthgonal projection onto the first L eigenvectors of empirical covariance matrix of the data. 
                    In general, it is known that if we introduce nonlinearities into the autoencoder, the model becomes strictly more powerful than PCA. 
                    Moreover, autoencoders designed with deep learning architectures handle large datasets and complex structures much better than Kernel PCA, so 
                    autoencoders have generally become more popular than Kernel PCA for nonlinear mapping in practical applications.

                <h2>Demo: Kernel PCA and Autoencoders</h2>
                <p>
                    This interactive demo allows you to explore and compare different dimensionality reduction techniques:
                </p>
                
                <h3>PCA Comparison Tab</h3>
                <p>
                    Compare how <strong>standard PCA</strong> and <strong>Kernel PCA</strong> handle non-linear datasets. 
                    Standard PCA finds linear projections, while Kernel PCA can "unfold" complex structures like circles and spirals 
                    using the kernel trick. Try different kernels (RBF, polynomial) and adjust parameters to see their effects.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Autoencoder Tab</h3>
                <p>
                    Explore how a <strong>neural network autoencoder</strong> with a 1D bottleneck learns to compress and reconstruct 
                    2D data. Unlike PCA which finds linear subspaces, the autoencoder learns non-linear mappings through its hidden layers. 
                    The 1D latent space visualization shows how the network arranges data points along a single dimension, effectively 
                    finding the principal curve through the data.

                    <strong>💡 Tip:</strong> Start with the "circles" dataset to see how each method handles non-linear structure. 
                    PCA will struggle, Kernel PCA (with RBF kernel) will separate the circles, and the autoencoder will "unfold" 
                    them into a line.

                <h2>Denoising Autoencoders</h2>
                <p>
                    To regularize a model, <strong>denoising autoencoder</strong> adds noise to its input data and 
                    then trains the model for reconstructing an uncorrupted version of the original input data. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, a denoising autoencoder can be trained by Gaussian corruption and squared error reconstruction:
                     \[
                     p_c (\tilde{x} | x) = \mathcal{N}(\tilde{x} | x, \sigma^2 I)
                     \]
                     \[
                     \ell (x, r(\tilde{x})) = \| e \|_2^2 
                     \]
                     where \(e(x) = r(\tilde{x} - x) \) is the residual error for a sample \(x\). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As \(\sigma \to 0\), the residual error approximates the score function: 
                    \[
                    e(x) \approx \nabla_x \log p(x).
                    \]
                    So, the denosing autoencoder learns a vector field corresponding to the gradient of the log data density.
