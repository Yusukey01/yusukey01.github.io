                    So far in both regression and classification problems, we have used probabilistic predictors. Here, we learn 
                    a non-probalistic method. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models that find an optimal 
                    hyperplane separating classes by maximizing the margin between data points and the decision boundary; this 
                    margin-based approach often leads to strong generalization, especially in high dimensional spaces with limited 
                    samples. By employing the “kernel trick” (e.g., Gaussian RBF or polynomial kernels), SVMs can implicitly map inputs 
                    into higher dimensional feature spaces, enabling the classification of nonlinearly separable data without explicitly 
                    computing those transformations . Despite the rise of deep learning, SVMs remain valuable for small- to medium-sized 
                    datasets, offering robustness and interpretability through a sparse set of support vectors.
