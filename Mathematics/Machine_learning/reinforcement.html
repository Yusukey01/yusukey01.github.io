                <p>
                    <strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</strong> is a machine learning framework in which an <strong>agent</strong> interacts 
                    with an environment to learn a behavior that maximizes a scalar <strong>reward</strong> signal over time. 
                    Formally, the environment is typically modeled as a <strong>Markov Decision Process (MDP)</strong>, defined by a tuple 
                    \[
                    (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, r, \gamma)
                    \]
                    where \(\mathcal{S}\) is the state space, \(\mathcal{A}\) is the action space, \(\mathcal{T}\) is the transition function, 
                    \(r\) is the reward function, and \(\gamma\) is the discount factor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At each time step, the agent observes a state \(s_t \in \mathcal{S}\), selects an action \(a_t \in \mathcal{A}\), receives a 
                    reward \(r_t\), and transitions to a new state \(s_{t+1}\) according to the transition dynamics \(\mathcal{T}(s_{t+1} \mid s_t, a_t)\). 
                    The goal of the agent is to learn a <strong>policy</strong> \(\pi(a \mid s)\) that maximizes the expected cumulative reward:
                    \[
                    \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t \right].
                    \]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reinforcement learning differs from <strong>supervised learning</strong>, where models are trained on ground-truth input-output pairs, 
                    and from <strong>unsupervised learning</strong>, which aims to discover hidden structure or representations in unlabeled data.
                    In RL, learning is driven by a scalar <em>reward signal</em> that provides evaluative feedback based on the agent's interaction with an environment.
                    Unlike supervised learning, there are no correct labels for each input, and unlike unsupervised learning, the objective is not to model data structure 
                    but to learn a policy that maximizes expected cumulative reward over time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    RL has been successfully applied in domains such as robotics, recommendation systems, and game-playing.
                    More recently, RL has also become integral to the training of modern <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>. 
                    In particular, a method called <strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</strong> is used to fine-tune LLMs 
                    to follow <strong>human preferences</strong>, ensuring outputs are more helpful, safe, and aligned with user intent.
