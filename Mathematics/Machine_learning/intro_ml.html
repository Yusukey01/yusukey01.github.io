        <h1>The Law of Intelligence</h1>
        <blockquote>
            We have yet to uncover the fundamental law(s) of intelligence, and until we do, creating "true" artificial 
            intelligence (AI) remains elusive. Why is such a rule essential? Consider how both airplanes and birds can able to 
            fly in the sky under the same laws of aerodynamics, enabling scientists to explain the phenomenon of flight. Similarly, understanding 
            the laws of intelligence would provide a framework for defining and replicating it artificially.
            Currently, we lack a clear understanding of what intelligence truly is. However, at least we assume that AI should follow 
            fundamental principles of information processing and Bayesian decision theory. These principles form a foundation, but 
            they do not fully capture the complexities observed in living creatures. In nature, even humans often rely on algorithmic 
            shortcuts, or heuristics, that deviate from strictly optimal solutions. For example, in our life, sometimes optical illusion occurs 
            due to the "shortcuts," but human brain does not need detailed calculations to recognize objects. 
            This observation suggests that insights from neuroscience and cognitive science can play a vital role in advancing AI. 
            By studying how biological systems approximate solutions, we could develop practical approaches.

        <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote class="gray-bg">
            A computer program is said to learn from experience \(E\) with respect to some class of tasks \(T\), and 
            performance measure \(P\), if its performance at tasks in \(T\), as measured by \(P\), improves with 
            experience \(E\).

        <h1>Basic Categories of Machine Learning</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Regression</strong></li>
                Predicting a continuous value based on input features.
                <br>
                Examples: Forecasting temperature, stock prices. Predicting housing price based on features.
                <br>
                Methods: Linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, 
                <li><strong>Classification</strong></li>
                Assigning inputs into predefined categories or labels.
                <br>
                Examples: Spam detection, Diagnosis of disease, Image recognition
                <br>
                Methods: Logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks.
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong></li>
                Learning structures from data without labeled outputs.
                <br>
                Examples: Finding similar images, Community detection.
                <br>
                Methods: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, PCA, autoencoders

        <h1>Standard Process of ML</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Collect Data</strong></li>
                Randomly split the data into Train and Test. 
                <li><strong>Choose a Hypothesis Class or Model</strong></li>
                Capture the patterns in the data
                <li><strong>Choose a Loss Function</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Choose an Optimization Procedure</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Justify the Accuracy of the Estimation(Prediction)</strong></li>
                Apply the model to predict future unknown observations.
