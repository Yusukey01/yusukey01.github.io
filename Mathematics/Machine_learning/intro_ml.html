                <h2>The Law of Intelligence</h2>
                <p> 
                    but they do not fully capture the complexities observed in living creatures. In nature, even humans often rely on algorithmic 
                    shortcuts, or heuristics, that deviate from strictly optimal solutions. For example, in our life, sometimes optical illusion occurs 
                    due to the "shortcuts," but human brain does not need detailed calculations to recognize objects. 
                    This observation suggests that insights from neuroscience and cognitive science can play a vital role in advancing AI. 
                    By studying how biological systems approximate solutions, we could develop practical approaches.

                <strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> has become one of the most influential technologies of our time, powering 
                applications from search engines to self-driving cars. Before diving into its technical details, it's worth stepping back 
                and asking: what is <strong>intelligence</strong> itself, and what does it mean to replicate it artificially?
                </p>

                <p>
                For example, the laws of motion and aerodynamics govern both natural and human-made flight. 
                We accept without hesitation that birds can fly through the air, and we trust airplanes to carry us safely across continents. 
                This shared trust comes from our understanding of the same physical principles that explain both. Similarly, if we could uncover 
                the fundamental laws of intelligence, we might someday build machines that "think" with the same confidence we have in machines 
                that fly.
                </p>

                <p>
                Even though creating a truly intelligent system — one that rivals the flexibility and generality of the human mind — remains an 
                open scientific challenge, we do have guiding principles. Modern approaches to AI are built on frameworks like <strong>Bayesian decision theory</strong> 
                and <strong>information processing</strong>. These form the theoretical foundation for <strong>machine learning (ML)</strong> is 
                a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve 
                their performance on specific tasks over time.
                </p>

                <p>
                One branch of machine learning, called <strong>deep learning</strong>, uses large neural networks inspired by the brain to perform complex 
                tasks such as image recognition, language translation, and game playing. However, even these powerful models lack the rich generalization 
                abilities of biological systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                Despite their impressive performance, these models still have limitations. LLMs can mimic reasoning, but they lack true understanding, adaptability, 
                and self-awareness. They rely on vast amounts of data and compute power, and they do not yet match the efficiency or flexibility of human cognition. 
                This invites a deeper question: what makes natural intelligence so effective — and how might we capture some of that power in artificial systems?
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                In nature, intelligent organisms often rely on <em>heuristics</em> — simple, fast approximations — rather than fully rational or optimal solutions. 
                The human brain, for example, can recognize faces and objects almost instantly, sometimes even producing optical illusions due to its shortcuts. 
                This observation suggests that the future of AI may benefit not only from mathematics and computer science, but also from insights in neuroscience, 
                cognitive science, and psychology.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                To build truly intelligent machines, we may need to understand not just how to compute optimally, but how to approximate intelligently.
