                <p>
                    <strong>Clustering</strong> is one of the core tasks in <strong>unsupervised learning</strong>. Unlike supervised learning, where models learn from labeled data, 
                    unsupervised learning aims to uncover hidden patterns or structures in data without any predefined labels. Among these tasks, clustering 
                    is particularly important — it groups data points into clusters based on their similarity, revealing the underlying structure of the data.

                <p>
                    In previous sections, we explored techniques like <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong> and <strong>autoencoders</strong>, which 
                    reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data while preserving meaningful information. These dimensionality reduction methods helped us uncover 
                    compact representations of data, often referred to as <strong>latent features</strong>.

                <p>
                    Now that we have the tools to represent complex data in a lower-dimensional space, we turn to the next natural question: 
                    <strong>Can we identify meaningful groupings within this reduced space?</strong> This is the goal of clustering, which allows us to segment 
                    data into coherent groups — for example, grouping similar images, organizing unlabeled documents, or detecting communities in social networks.

                we will begin with <strong>K-means clustering</strong>, one of the most widely used and intuitive algorithms.
