        <blockquote>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                <strong>Machine Learning</strong> is a combination of data, hypotheses, and prediction. While the field evolves rapidly with new methods 
                and algorithms, the foundational concepts remain critical. This section provides an overview of the core ideas 
                in machine learning. Because specific methods and tools can become outdated quickly, I strongly encourage you to invest time in studying 
                the mathematical knowledges covered in other sections. A solid grasp of these concepts equips you with the ability to understand, 
                adapt, and even create new approaches as the field progresses.
