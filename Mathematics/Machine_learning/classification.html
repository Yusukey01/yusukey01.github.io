                <h2>Binary Logistic Regression</h2>
                <p>
                    Consider discriminative <strong>classification</strong> model: 
                    \[
                    p(y \mid x, \theta)  
                    \]
                    where \(x \in \mathbb{R}^D\) is an input vector, \(y \in \{1, \cdots, C\}\) is the class label, 
                    and \(\theta\) are the parameters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When \(C = 2\), it is known as <strong>binary logistic regression</strong>. The mode can be represented by: 
                    \[
                     p(y \mid x, \theta) = \text{Ber }(y \mid \sigma(w^\top x + b))
                    \]
                    where \(\sigma\) is the <strong>sigmoid(logistic) function</strong>, \(w \in \mathbb{R}^D\) are the weights, 
                    \(b \in mathbb{R}\) is a bias, and \(\theta = (w, b)\) are all the parameters. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, 
                    \[
                    p(y = 1 \mid x, \theta) = \sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}
                    \]
                    where \(a\) is called the <strong>logit</strong>(or the <strong>pre-activation</strong>): 
                    \[
                     a = w^\top x + b = \log (\frac{p}{1-p}), \quad p = p(y = 1 \mid x, \theta).
                    \]
                </p>

                <p>
                    The sigmoid function measures the probability that the class label is \(y =1\). So, we want to set a decision rule such that 
                    \(y =1\) if and only if the class 1 is more likely than class 0. In other worlds, 
                    \[
                    \begin{align*}
                    f(x) &= \mathbb{I}(p(y=1 \mid x) > p(y=0 \mid x)) \\\\
                         &= \mathbb{I} \left( \log \frac{p(y =  1 \mid x)}{p(y =0 \mid x)} > 0 \right) \\\\
                         &= \mathbb{I}(a).
                    \end{align*}
                    \]
                    Therefore, the prediction function can be written as following: 
                    \[
                    f(x ; \theta) = b + w^\top x.
                    \]
                    Since \(w^\top x\) is the <strong>inner product</strong> between the weight vector \(w\) and the feature vector \(x\), in the end 
                    this function determines a <strong>linear hyperplane</strong> with normal vector \(w\) and an offset \(b\) from the origin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note: Often instead of \(y \in \{0, 1\}\), we use the labels \(\tilde{y} \in \{-1, 1\}\). In this case, 
                    \[
                    \sigma(-a) = 1 - \sigma(a)
                    \]
                    and then: 
                    \[
                    p(\tilde{y} \mid x, \theta) = \sigma(\tilde{y}a).
                    \]
