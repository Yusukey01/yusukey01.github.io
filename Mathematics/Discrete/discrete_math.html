        <h1>Discrete Mathematics & Algorithms</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                <strong>Discrete mathematics</strong> and <strong>algorithms</strong> bring together key topics from both mathematics and 
                computer science that are essential for modern computational methods. Discrete mathematics, as a distinct branch of 
                mathematics, explores well-defined structures—like graphs, sets, and combinatorial systems—that support clear logical reasoning and 
                analysis. In parallel, the study of algorithms, central to computer science, focuses on designing systematic procedures for solving 
                complex problems efficiently. This section unites these interrelated areas, reflecting their synergy in advancing machine learning. 
                This section will cover core topics including <strong>graph theory</strong>, <strong>combinatorics</strong>, the <strong>theory of computation</strong> 
                and more. Whether you are interested in the abstract reasoning of mathematics or the practical implementation of efficient algorithms, 
                blending theoretical insights with practical algorithm design gives you a comprehensive foundation for analyzing and optimizing computational processes.
