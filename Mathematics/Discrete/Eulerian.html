            <h2>Eulerian</h2>
            <p>
            The <strong>PATH problem</strong> asks whether a directed path exists from vertex \(s\) to vertex \(t\). In this section, 
            we explore key path-related concepts that bridge computer science and mathematics.
            <br><br>
            A graph is called <strong>Eulerian</strong> if it contains an <strong>Eulerian cycle (Euler tour)</strong> - a <strong>closed</strong> 
            walk that traverses every edge exactly once allowing for revisiting vertices. This idea originates from Leonhard Euler's groundbreaking 
            work on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, which laid the foundations of graph theory.
            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Theorem 1 (Euler 1736): </span>
                A connected graph is Eulerian if and only if every vertex has even degree. 
            </div>
            Similarly, a graph is called <strong>semi-Eulerian</strong> if it contains an <strong>Eulerian path (Eulerian trail)</strong> - 
            any trail that traverses every edge of a graph exactly once, but it does not have to be closed - it may start and end at different vertices. 
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="Images/Eulerian.jpg" alt="PDA" style="width:600px;">
            </div>
            <ul  style="padding-left: 40px;">
                <li>Graph 1 is Eulerian since every vertex has degree 2.</li>
                <li>Graph 2 is Semi-Eulerian since it has a Eulerian path, but not cycle.</li>
                <li>Graph 3 is Eulerian since vertex A has degree 4, and the others have degree 2.</li>
            </ul>
            In Graph 3, we have to "revisit" the vertex A to construct an Eulerian cycle. On the other hand, Graph 1 does not 
            require revisiting vertices (except for starting vertex which is visited twice as it closes the cycle).
            </p>

            <section id="Hamiltonian" class="section-content">
            <h2>Hamiltonian</h2>
            <p>
            A graph is called <strong>Hamiltonian</strong> if it contains a <strong>Hamiltonian cycle</strong>, which is a closed path 
            that visits every <strong>vertex</strong> exactly once except for starting vertex. 
            <br><br>
            So, Graph 1 is Hamiltonian, but Graph 3 is not Hamiltonian. Since the Hamiltonian cycle only care about vertices, we don't 
            have to use all edges in the graph to construct the cyle. So, a graph is Hamiltonian does not imply it is Eulerian. For 
            example, the following Graph 4 is Hamiltonian but not Eulerian.
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="Images/Hamiltonian.jpg" alt="PDA" style="width:400px;">
            </div>
            (For instance, there is a Hamiltonian cycle: \(A \to G \to C \to I \to K \to H \to B \to F \to E \to D \to J \to A\).)
            <br><br>
            By Theorem 1, determining whether or not a given graph has a Eulerian is not hard( it's in the <a href="time_complexity.html">class P </a>), 
            but deciding whether it is Hamiltonian is much harder(it's in the class <strong>NP-complete</strong>) because there is no good characterization 
            is known. Note that even though it is hard to determine whether or not a given graph is Hamiltonian, if someone gives you a proposed 
            Hamiltonian cycle, it is easy to verify it in polynomial time by checking that it visits each vertex exactly once and forms a valid cycle.

            <p>
            Let's make an <strong>adjacency matrix</strong> for Graph 4: 
            \[
            G_4 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                                  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                                  0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                                  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                                  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                                  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                                  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                                  0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                                  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                                  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                                  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 
             \end{bmatrix}   
            \]
            In the adjacency matrix, the \((i, j)\)th entry is 1 if there is an edge from vertex \(i\) to vertex \(j\), and 0 if not. 
            For example, the first row represents connections between vertex A and all vertices including vertex A itself. 
            <br><br>
            Let \(n\) be the number of vertices in a given graph. The adjacency matrix requires \(O(n^2)\) "memory space." So far, we have 
            discussed only time complexity, in other words, the "performance" for certain operations. However, real computer does not have 
            infinite memory size. <strong>Space complexity</strong> does matter. The adjacency matrix has \(O(n^2)\) space complexity. 
            For large \(n\), it costs too much memory space, and most real-world graphs are <strong>sparse</strong> (few edges compared to 
            \(n^2\) possible edges), so using the adjacency matrix can be wasteful. In the following code, we use the <strong>adjacency list</strong>
            instead of the adjacency matrix.
