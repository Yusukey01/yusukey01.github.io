        <h1>Graph Theory</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Graph theory is a core area of discrete mathematics that focuses on the study of <strong>graphs</strong> â€” mathematical "structures" 
            made up of vertices and edges that connect them. Theoretically, it provides rigorous frameworks to understand properties 
            like connectivity, cycles, and network flows, offering deep insights into the underlying structure of complex systems. On 
            the practical side, graph theory helps model relationships in social networks, improve recommendation systems, and it is also 
            used in advanced techniques like graph-based machine learning models.

        <h1>Graph</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A <strong>graph</strong> is a mathematical structure used to model relationships between objects. It consists of a set of 
            <strong>vertices</strong> (or nodes) and a set of <strong>edges</strong> (or connections) between them. Formally, a graph is defined as:
            \[
            G = (V, E)
            \]
            where \(V\) is a set of <strong>vertices</strong>, denoted \(G(V)\), and \(E\) is a set of <strong>edges</strong>, denoted \(G(E)\).
            Their <strong>cardinalities</strong> are denoted as \(v(G) = |V(G)|\) and \(e(G) = |E(G)|\).
            <br><br>
            Graphs come in different types, depending on how edges are defined:
            <br><br>
            In an <strong>undirected graph</strong>, edges have no direction; they simply connect two vertices. Formally, each edge is an unordered pair
            of distinct vertices:
            \[
            E \subseteq \binom{V}{2}.
            \]
            <br>
            In a <strong>directed graph</strong>, each edge has a direction, meaning it points from one vertex to another. Formally, edges are 
            ordered pairs:
            \[
            E \subseteq V \times V.
            \]
            <br>
            A <strong>multigraph</strong> allows multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. A multigraph is represented as:
            \[
            G = (V, E, \mu)
            \]
            where \(mu: E \to \mathbb{N}\) is a function that assigns a multiplicity to each edge, representing how many times 
            the edge appears between two vertices.
            <br><br>
            A <strong>weighted graph</strong> assigns a numerical value (or "weight") to each edge, often representing cost, distance, or strength 
            of the connection. A weighted graph is represented as:
            \[
            G = (V, E, w)
            \]
            where \(w: E \to \mathbb{R}\) is a function assigning a weight to each edge. Weighted graphs are widely used in shortest path algorithms 
            and network optimization problems.
            <br><br>
            The <strong>neighborhood</strong> of a vertex \(x\), denoted \(N_G (x)\) (or simply \(N(x)\)) is the set of vertices 
            \(y\) such that \(xy\) is an edge.
            <br><br>
            The <strong>degree</strong> of a vertex \(x\) is defined as the number of neighborhoods of \(x\) and 
            is denoted as \(\text{deg }_G (x) = | N_G(x) |\)(or \(\text{deg }(x)\)). Moreover, for directed graphs, we define 
            the in-degree \(\text{deg }^-(x)\), the number of edges directed into \(x\) and the out-degree \(\text{deg }^+ (x)\), 
            the number of edges directed out of \(x\).
            <br><br>
            For any  subset \(A \subseteq V(G)\), we define \(e(A)\) as the number of edges with "both endpoints" in \(A\). More generally, 
            given two subsets \(A, B \subseteq V(G)\) we define:
            \[
            e(A, B) = | \{ (a, b) \in A \times B: ab \in E(G)\} |.
            \]
            This represents the number of edges between the sets \(A\) and \(B\). If \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, then \(e(A, B)\) counts 
            only edges that connect vertices in \(A\) to vertices in \(B\).
