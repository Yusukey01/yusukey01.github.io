        <h1>Graph Theory</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Graph theory is a core area of discrete mathematics that focuses on the study of <strong>graphs</strong> â€” mathematical "structures" 
            made up of vertices and edges that connect them. Theoretically, it provides rigorous frameworks to understand properties 
            like connectivity, cycles, and network flows, offering deep insights into the underlying structure of complex systems. On 
            the practical side, graph theory helps model relationships in social networks, improve recommendation systems, and it is also 
            used in advanced techniques like graph-based machine learning models.

        <h1>Graph</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A <strong>graph</strong> is a mathematical structure used to model relationships between objects. It consists of a set of 
            <strong>vertices</strong> (or nodes) and a set of <strong>edges</strong> (or connections) between them. Formally, a graph is defined as:
            \[
            G = (V, E)
            \]
            where \(V\) is a set of <strong>vertices</strong>, denoted as \(G(V)\), and \(E\) is a set of <strong>edges</strong>, denoted as \(G(E)\).
            In most cases, we assume graphs are finite, but they can be infinite.
            <br><br>
            Typically, \(|G|\) denotes the number of vertices on the graph \(G\), which is the cardinality of the vertex set \(V(G)\), and also we call it 
            the <strong>order</strong> of \(G\):
            \[
            the order of the graph G  = |G| = |V(G)|.
            \]
            Similarly, \(|E(G)|\) denotes the cardinality of the edge set \(E(G)\).  Usually, an edge \(\{x, y\} \in E(G) \) is denoted as \(xy \in E(G)\) 
            where \(x, y \in V(G)\). 
            <br><br>
            Graphs come in different types, depending on how edges are defined:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Undirected graph</strong>:</li>
                    Each edge has no direction, and simply connects two vertices. Formally, edges are unordered pairs
                    of distinct vertices:
                    \[
                    E \subseteq \binom{V}{2}.
                    \]
                <li><strong>Directed graph</strong>:</li>
                    Each edge has a direction, and points from one vertex to another. Formally, edges are ordered pairs:
                    \[
                    E \subseteq V \times V.
                    \]
                <li><strong>Weighted graph</strong>:</li>
                    It assigns a numerical value (or "weight") to each edge, often representing cost, distance, or strength of the connection. 
                    Weighted graphs are widely used in shortest path algorithms and network optimization problems. It is represented as:
                    \[
                     G = (V, E, w)
                    \]
                    where \(w: E \to \mathbb{R}\) is a function assigning a weight to each edge. 
                    <br>
                <li><strong>Multigraph</strong>:</li>
                    It allows multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. It is represented as:
                    \[
                    G = (V, E, \mu)
                    \]
                    where \(mu: E \to \mathbb{N}\) is a function that assigns a multiplicity to each edge, representing how many times 
                    the edge appears between two vertices.
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <h1>Neighbors</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Two vertices \(x, y \in V(G)\) are <strong>adjacent</strong> or <strong>neighbors</strong> if \(xy \in E(G)\). If every vertex 
            of \(G\) are pairwise adjacent, the the graph \(G\) said to be <strong>complete graph</strong>. For example, a complete graph on 3 
            vertices is indeed, a triangle, denoted as \(K_3\). 
            <br><br>
            Note: The set of neighbors of a vertex \(x\) is the set of vertices \(y\) such that \(xy \in E(G)\). Typically, it is written as 
            \(N_G (x)\) (or simply \(N(x)\)).
            <br><br>
            Similarly, two edges \(e \neq f\) are adjacent if they have a commom end. Also, a set of vertices(or edges) is <strong>independent</strong> 
            if no two of its elements are adjacent. 
            <br><br>
            For any subset \(A \subseteq V(G)\), we define \(e(A)\) as the number of edges with "both endpoints" in \(A\). More generally, 
            given two subsets \(A, B \subseteq V(G)\) we define:
            \[
            e(A, B) = | \{ (a, b) \in A \times B: ab \in E(G)\} |.
            \]
            This represents the number of edges between the sets \(A\) and \(B\). If \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, then \(e(A, B)\) counts 
            only edges that connect vertices in \(A\) to vertices in \(B\).
        </blockquote>

        <h1>Degrees</h1>
        <blockquote>
            The <strong>degree</strong> of a "vertex" \(x\) is defined as the number of neighbors of \(x\) and 
            is denoted as \(\text{deg }_G (x) = | N_G(x) |\)(or \(\text{deg }(x)\)). Moreover, for directed graphs, we define 
            the <strong>in-degree</strong> \(\text{deg }^-(x)\), the number of edges directed into \(x\) and the <strong>out-degree </strong> 
            \(\text{deg }^+ (x)\), the number of edges directed out of \(x\).
            <br><br>
            The <strong>minimum degree</strong> and <strong>maximum degree</strong> of \(G\) is written as follows respectively: 
            \[
            \delta(G) = \min \{\text{deg }(x) | x \in V\}
            \]
            \[
            \Delta(G) = \max \{\text{deg }(x) | x \in V\}
            \]
            and the <strong>average degree</strong> of a "graph" \(G\) is written as \(d(G)\), which always holds:
            \[
            \delta(G) \leq d(G) \leq \Delta(G).
            \]
            In addition, if every vertex of a graph have the same degree \(k\), the graph said to be <strong>\(k\)-regular</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Let \(\epsilon(G) = \frac{|E|}{|V|}\). This is the number of edges per vertex on \(G\). This ratio is related with the average 
            degree of \(G\) as follows:
            \[
            |E| = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{x \in V} \text{deg }(x)  = \frac{1}{2} d(G) |V|
            \]
            and thus
            \[
            \frac{1}{2}d(G) = \epsilon(G) =  \frac{|E|}{|V|}.
            \]
            (Try: If we count every edge of \(G\) twice, it is equals to the sum of all vertex degrees in \(G\).)
        </blockquote>

        <h1>Isomorphism</h1>
        <blockquote>
            The two graphs \(G = (V, E)\) and \(G' = (V', E')\) said to be <strong>isomorphic</strong>, \(G \simeq G'\), if 
            there exists a bijection:
            \[
            \varphi: V \to V' , \quad  xy \in E  \iff  \forall x, y \in v, \quad \varphi(x)\varphi(y) \in E'
             \]
             Such a map \(\varphi\) is called an <strong>isomorphism</strong>. If \(G = G'\), it is called <strong>automorphism</strong>.
             <br><br>
             A class of graphs that is closed under isomorphism is called a <strong>graph property</strong>. If a map \(\varphi(G)\) assings equal values 
             to isomorphic graphs, the map is said to be a <strong>graph invariant</strong>.
            <br><br><br>
            We can apply set operations to graphs: 
            \[
            G \cup G' = (V \cup V', E \cup E') \quad  G \cap G' = (V \cap V', E \cap E').
            \]
            If \(G \cap G' = \emptyset\), then they are <strong>disjoint</strong>.
            <br>
            If \(V \subseteq V'\) and \(E \subseteq E'\), then \(G'\) is <strong>subgraph</strong> of \(G\) and \(G\) is 
            <strong>supergraph</strong> of \(G'\), denoted as \(G' \subseteq G\).
            <br>
            If \(G' \subseteq G\) and \(G'\) contains all edges \(xy \in E\) with \(x, y \in V'\), then \(G'\) is an 
            <strong>induced subgraph</strong> of \(G\). We write:
            \[
            G' = G[V']
            \]
            (\(V'\) induces or spans \(G'\) in \(G\).)
            <br><br>
            So, if \(U \subseteq V\) is any set of vertices, then \(G[U]\) is the graph on \(U\) whose edges are the edges of \(G\) 
            with both ends in \(U\). If \(H\) is not necessarily an induced subgraph, we write \(G(H)\) instead of \(G[V(H)]\).
            <br>
            If \(V'\) spans all of \(G\), or \(V' = V\), the subgraph \(G'\) is said to be <strong>spanning subgraph</strong> of \(G\).
