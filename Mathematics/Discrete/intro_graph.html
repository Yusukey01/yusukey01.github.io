        <h1>Graph Theory</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Graph theory is a core area of discrete mathematics that focuses on the study of <strong>graphs</strong> â€” mathematical "structures" 
            made up of vertices and edges that connect them. Theoretically, it provides rigorous frameworks to understand properties 
            like connectivity, cycles, and network flows, offering deep insights into the underlying structure of complex systems. On 
            the practical side, graph theory helps model relationships in social networks, improve recommendation systems, and it is also 
            used in advanced techniques like graph-based machine learning models.

        <h1>Graph</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A <strong>graph</strong> is a mathematical structure used to model relationships between objects. It consists of a set of 
            <strong>vertices</strong> (or nodes) and a set of <strong>edges</strong> (or connections) between them. Formally, a graph is defined as:
            \[
            G = (V, E)
            \]
            where \(V\) is a set of <strong>vertices</strong>, denoted as \(G(V)\), and \(E\) is a set of <strong>edges</strong>, denoted as \(G(E)\).
            Their <strong>cardinalities</strong> are denoted as \(v(G) = |V(G)|\) and \(e(G) = |E(G)|\). Also, we call the number of vertices of a graph \(G\) 
            the <strong>order</strong> of the graph, denoted as \(|G|\), while the number of edges of the graph is written as \(\|G\|\). In most cases, we assume 
            graphs are finite, but they can be infinite. In most cases, we won't consider the empty graph \((\emptyset, \emptyset)\).
            <br><br>
            Usually, an edge \(\{x, y\}\) is denoted as \(xy\). 
            <br>
            For any  subset \(A \subseteq V(G)\), we define \(e(A)\) as the number of edges with "both endpoints" in \(A\). More generally, 
            given two subsets \(A, B \subseteq V(G)\) we define:
            \[
            e(A, B) = | \{ (a, b) \in A \times B: ab \in E(G)\} |.
            \]
            This represents the number of edges between the sets \(A\) and \(B\). If \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, then \(e(A, B)\) counts 
            only edges that connect vertices in \(A\) to vertices in \(B\).
            <br><br><br>
            Graphs come in different types, depending on how edges are defined:
            <br><br>
            In an <strong>undirected graph</strong>, edges have no direction; they simply connect two vertices. Formally, each edge is an unordered pair
            of distinct vertices:
            \[
            E \subseteq \binom{V}{2}.
            \]
            <br>
            In a <strong>directed graph</strong>, each edge has a direction, meaning it points from one vertex to another. Formally, edges are 
            ordered pairs:
            \[
            E \subseteq V \times V.
            \]
            <br>
            A <strong>multigraph</strong> allows multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. A multigraph is represented as:
            \[
            G = (V, E, \mu)
            \]
            where \(mu: E \to \mathbb{N}\) is a function that assigns a multiplicity to each edge, representing how many times 
            the edge appears between two vertices.
            <br><br>
            A <strong>weighted graph</strong> assigns a numerical value (or "weight") to each edge, often representing cost, distance, or strength 
            of the connection. A weighted graph is represented as:
            \[
            G = (V, E, w)
            \]
            where \(w: E \to \mathbb{R}\) is a function assigning a weight to each edge. Weighted graphs are widely used in shortest path algorithms 
            and network optimization problems.
            <br><br><br>
            Two vertices \(x\) and \(y\) of \(G\) are <strong>adjacent</strong> or <strong>neighbours</strong> if \(xy\) is an edge of \(G\), and the 
            set of vertices \(y\) such that \(xy\) is an edge of \(G\) is written as \(N_G (x)\) (or simply \(N(x)\)). Similarly, edges \(e \neq f\) are 
            adjacent if they have a commom end. Also, a set of vertices(or edges) is <strong>independent</strong> if no two of its elements are adjacent. 
            <br>
            If every vertex of \(G\) are pairwise adjacent, the the graph \(G\) said to be <strong>complete graph</strong>. For example, 
            a complete graph on 3 vertices is indeed, a triangle, denoted as \(K_3\).

            <br><br><br>
            The <strong>degree</strong> of a vertex \(x\) is defined as the number of neighbors of \(x\) and 
            is denoted as \(\text{deg }_G (x) = | N_G(x) |\)(or \(\text{deg }(x)\)). Moreover, for directed graphs, we define 
            the in-degree \(\text{deg }^-(x)\), the number of edges directed into \(x\) and the out-degree \(\text{deg }^+ (x)\), 
            the number of edges directed out of \(x\).
            <br><br>
            The <strong>minimum degree</strong> and <strong>maximum degree</strong> of \(G\) is written as follows respectively: 
            \[
            \delta(G) = \min \{\text{deg }(x) | x \in V\}
            \]
            \[
            \Delta(G) = \max \{\text{deg }(x) | x \in V\}
            \]
            and the <strong>average degree</strong> of \(G\) is written as \(\text{deg }(G)\), which always holds  \(\delta(G) \leq \text{deg }(G) \leq \Delta(G)\). 
            In addition, if every vertex of a graph have the same degree \(k\), the graph said to be <strong>\(k\)-regular</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Let \(\epsilon(G) = \frac{|E|}{|V|}\). This is the number of edges per vertex on \(G\). This ratio is related with the average 
            degree of \(G\) as follows:
            \[
            |E| = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{x \in V} \text{deg }(x)  = \frac{1}{2} \text{deg }(G) |V|
            \]
            and thus
            \[
            \frac{1}{2}\text{deg }(G) = \epsilon(G) =  \frac{|E|}{|V|}.
            \]
            (Try: If we count every edge of \(G\) twice, it is equals to the sum of all vertex degrees in \(G\).)

        <h1>Isomorphism</h1>
        <blockquote>
            The two graphs \(G = (V, E)\) and \(G' = (V', E')\) said to be <strong>isomorphic</strong>, \(G \simeq G'\), if 
            there exists a bijection:
            \[
            \varphi: V \to V' , \quad  xy \in E  \iff  \forall x, y \in v, \quad \varphi(x)\varphi(y) \in E'
             \]
             Such a map \(varphi\) is called an <strong>isomorphism</strong>. If \(G = G'\), it is called <strong>automorphism</strong>.
             <br><br>
             A class of graphs that is closed under isomorphism is called a <strong>graph property</strong>. If a map \(varphi(G)\) assings equal values 
             to isomorphic graphs, the map is said to be a <strong>graph invariant</strong>.
            <br><br><br>
            We can apply set operations to graphs: 
            \[
            G \cup G' = (V \cup V', E \cup E') \quad  G \cap G' = (V \cap V', E \cap E').
            \]
            If \(G \cap G' = \emptyset\), then they are <strong>disjoint</strong>.
            <br>
            If \(V \subseteq V'\) and \(E \subseteq E'\), then \(G'\) is <strong>subgraph</strong> of \(G\) and \(G\) is 
            <strong>supergraph</strong> of \(G'\), denoted as \(G' \subseteq G\).
            <br>
            If \(G' \subseteq G\) and \(G'\) contains all edges \(xy \in E\) with \(x, y \in V'\), then \(G'\) is an 
            <strong>induced subgraph</strong> of \(G\). We write:
            \[
            G' = G[V']
            \]
            (\(V'\) induces or spans \(G'\) in \(G\).)
            <br><br>
            So, if \(U \subseteq V\) is any set of vertices, then \(G[U]\) is the graph on \(U\) whose edges are the edges of \(G\) 
            with both ends in \(U\). If \(H\) is not necessarily an induced subgraph, we write \(G(H)\) instead of \(G[V(H)]\).
            <br>
            If \(V'\) spans all of \(G\), or \(V' = V\), the subgraph \(G'\) is said to be <strong>spanning subgraph</strong> of \(G\).
