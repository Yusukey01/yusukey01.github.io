        <h1>Graph Theory</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Graph theory is a core area of discrete mathematics that focuses on the study of <strong>graphs</strong> â€” mathematical "structures" 
            made up of vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect them. Theoretically, it provides rigorous frameworks to understand properties 
            like connectivity, cycles, and network flows, offering deep insights into the underlying structure of complex systems. On 
            the practical side, graph theory helps model relationships in social networks, improve recommendation systems, and it is also 
            used in advanced techniques like graph-based machine learning models.

        <h1>Graph</h1>
        <blockquote>
            In mathematics, a <strong>graph</strong> is defined by 
            \[
            G = (V, E)
            \]
            where \(V\) is a finite set of <strong>vertices</strong>, denoted by \(G(V)\), and \(E\) is a set of <strong>edges</strong>, denoted by \(G(E)\).
            Their "sizes" (or formally <strong>cardinalities</strong>) are denoted by \(v(G) = |V(G)|\) and  \(e(G) = |E(G)|\).
            <br><br>
            Each edge is an unordered pair of distinct vertices: 
            \[
            E \subseteq \binom{V}{2}.
            \]
            Also, the <strong>neighborhood</strong> of a vertex \(x\), denoted by \(N_G (x)\) (or \(N(x)\)) is  is the set of vertices 
            \(y\) such that \(xy\) is an edge, and the <strong>degree</strong> of a vertex \(x\) is defined as the number of neighborhoods of \(x\) and 
            denoted by \(\text{deg }_G (x) = | N_G(x) |\)(or \(\text{deg }(x)\)).
            <br><br>
            For each \(A \subseteq V(G)\), we define \(e(A)\) as the number of edges with "both endpoints" in \(A\). Also, 
            Given \(A, B \subseteq V(G)\) we define:
            \[
            e(A, B) = | \{ (a, b) \in A \times B: ab \in E(G)\} |.
            \]
            If \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, this is the number of edges between \(A\) and \(B\).
