            <h2>Boolean Logic</h2>
            <p>
            In <strong>Boolean Logic</strong>, we can only use two valuses; <strong>TRUE</strong> and <strong>FALSE</strong>. 
            This mathematical system is the foundation of digital electronics and computer design. Often we represent TRUE by 1 
            and FALSE by 0, but this is just representation, technically, \(TRUE \neq 1\). 
            <br><br>
            Boolean values are manipulated with the Boolean operations as follows: 
            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Fundamental Boolean Operations:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Negation, NOT: \(\neg\)</strong></li>
                    The negation of a Boolean value is its opposite value. 
                    <br>
                    (e.g. \(\neg 1 = 0, \quad \neg 0 = 1\))
                    <li><strong>Conjunction, AND: \(\wedge\)</strong></li>
                    The conjunction of two Boolean values is 1 if <strong>both</strong> of those values (<strong>operands</strong>) are 1. 
                    <br>
                    (e.g. \(1 \wedge 0 = 0, \quad 1 \wedge 1 = 1, \quad 0 \wedge 0 = 0\))
                    <li><strong>Disjunction, OR: \(\vee\)</strong></li>
                    The disjunction of two Boolean values is 1 if <strong>either</strong> of those values is 1.
                    <br>
                    (e.g. \(1 \vee 0 = 1, \quad 1 \vee 1 = 1, \quad 0 \vee 0 = 0\))
                </ul>
            </div>
            More Boolean operations:  
            <br>
            <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Exclusive or, XOR: \(\oplus\)</strong></li>
                The exclusive or is 1 if either but not both of its two values is 1.
                <br>
                (e.g. \(1 \oplus 1 = 0, \quad 1 \oplus 0 = 1, \quad 0 \oplus 0 = 0\))
                <li><strong>Equality: \(\leftrightarrow\)</strong></li>
                The equality is 1 if both of its operands have the same value.
                <br>
                (e.g. \(1 \leftrightarrow 1 = 1, \quad 1 \leftrightarrow 0 = 0, \quad 0 \leftrightarrow 0 = 1\))
                <br>
                This is equivalent to <strong>XNOR</strong>, which is the logical complement of the XOR.
                <li><strong>Implication: \(\rightarrow\)</strong></li>
                The implication is 0 if its first operand is 1 and its second operand is 0. Otherwise, it's 1. 
                <br>
                (e.g. \(1 \rightarrow 1 = 1, \quad 1 \rightarrow 0 = 0, \quad 0 \rightarrow 0 = 1\))
            </ul>

            <h2>Negation of Conjunction & Disjunction</h2>
            <p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>NAND: \(\uparrow\)</strong></li>
                NAND is negation of conjunction:
                \[
                P \uparrow Q = \neg (P \wedge Q)
                \]
                So, it is TRUE unless both \(P\) and \(Q\) are TRUE. 
                (e.g. \(1 \uparrow 0 = 1, \quad 1 \uparrow 1 = 0, \quad 0 \uparrow  0 = 1\))
                <li><strong>NOR: \(\downarrow\)</strong></li>
                NOR is negation of disjunction:
                \[
                P \downarrow Q = \neg  (P \vee Q)
                \]
                So, it is TRUE if both \(P\) and \(Q\) are FALSE.
                (e.g. \(1 \downarrow 0 = 0, \quad 1 \downarrow 1 = 0, \quad 0 \downarrow 0 = 1\))
            </ul>
            Even though NAND and NOR are just negations of AND and OR, they are significant because they are 
            <strong>functionally complete</strong>. We can construct any Boolean operation using only NAND or only NOR. 
            Many CPU designs and memory circuits are built using NAND-based logic. Here, we learn the NAND operation. 
            <div class="proof">
                <span class="proof-title">NAND is Functionally Complete</span> 
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>NOT</li>
                    \[
                    \neg P = P \uparrow P
                    \]
                    <li>AND</li>
                    \[
                    P \wedge Q = (P \uparrow Q) \uparrow (P \uparrow Q)
                    \]
                    <li>OR</li>
                    \[
                    P \vee Q = (P \uparrow P) \uparrow (Q \uparrow Q)
                    \]
                </ul>
            </div>
            Note: Non-fundamental Boolean operations can be built using AND, OR, and NOT, so they can be represented by NAND.
            For example,  
            <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
            <li>Equality</li>
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            P \leftrightarrow Q &= (P \wedge Q) \vee (\neg P \wedge \neg Q) \\\\
                                &= (P \uparrow Q) \uparrow ((P \uparrow Q) \uparrow (Q \uparrow Q))
            \end{align*}
            \]
            <li>Implication</li>
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            P \rightarrow Q &= \neg P \vee Q \\\\
                            &= P \uparrow (Q \uparrow Q)
            \end{align*}
            \]
            </ul>

            <p>
            When we study Boolean logic as a purely mathematical system, the focus is on abstract algebraic properties. However, 
            when these Boolean functions are implemented in hardware, they are called <strong>logic gates</strong>.
            Computers are built using electronic components wired together in a design known as a <strong>digital circuit</strong>. Logic 
            gates are physically implemented using transistors, and each Boolean operation corresponds to a type of gate that controls the 
            flow of electrical signals.
            <br><br>
            However, circuits are not only used for physical hardware but also for theoretical models in computer science. When Boolean 
            functions are used to construct a computational model rather than a physical device, we refer to them as <strong>Boolean circuits</strong>. 
            These circuits serve as a fundamental concept in computational complexity theory, where they help analyze the efficiency and 
            limitations of different computational processes. Here, we only introduce the definition of Boolean circuits. We will revisit this topic 
            after learning complexity theory in the future.
            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Boolean Circuit:</span>
                A Boolean circuit is a collection of gates and inputs connected by wires. Cycles are not permitted. Gates take three forms: AND gates, 
                OR gates, and NOT gates.
            </div>
            Note: A Boolean circuit is said to be a <strong>directed acyclic graph (DAG)</strong>. Each node represents a logic gate or 
            an input variable. Input nodes (source nodes) represent Boolean variables. Internal nodes represent logic gates. A special output 
            node (sink node) represents the final output of the circuit. Edges represent the flow of information, showing how outputs of one 
            gate serve as inputs to another. These edges are directed because signals flow in one direction (from inputs toward outputs).
