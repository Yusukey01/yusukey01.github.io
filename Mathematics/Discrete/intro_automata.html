        <h1>Automata Theory</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Automata theory</strong> is a foundational area of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics that studies abstract 
            machines and computational problems. It provides a rigorous framework for understanding <strong>formal languages</strong>, state-based 
            computation, and algorithmic processes. For instance, automata theory is essential in compiler design, natural language processing, 
            software verification, and the study of complexity classes in <strong>computational theory</strong>. By exploring automata theory, we 
            will develop a deeper understanding of computation, logic, and the mathematical principles governing algorithmic processes.

        <h1>Finite automatons & Regular Langualges</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A <strong>a finite automaton</strong> is a 5-tuple \((Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\) where 
            <ul>
                <li>\(Q\) is a finite set called the <strong>states</strong></li>
                <li>\(\Sigma\) is a finite set called the <strong>alphabet</strong></li>
                <li>\(\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q\) is the <strong>transition function</strong></li>
                <li>\(q_0 \in Q\) is the <strong>start state</strong></li>
                <li>\(F \subseteq Q\) is the set of <strong>accept states</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Let \(A\) be the set of all strings that machine \(M\) accepts. We say that \(A\) is the <strong>language</strong> of 
            machine \(M\) and write:
            \[
            L(M) = A 
            \]
            We also say that \(M\) <strong>recognizes</strong> \(A\). Moreover, a language is called a <strong>regular language</strong> if 
            some finite automaton recognizes it.
            <br><br>
            Consider the following finite automaton. 
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="finite_automata.png" alt="Finite automata" style="width:600px;">
            </div> 
           First, this directed multigraph is called the <strong>state diagram</strong> of the finite automaton.
           It has three states, \(Q = \{q_1, q_2, q_3\}\), where \(q_1\) is the start state, and \(F = \{q_2\}\) is the 
           accept state which is denoted by a double circle. The arrows are transitions \(\delta\) from one state to another state.
           This automaton processes some string(in this case, \(\Sigma =\{0, 1\}\)) as an input and returns either accept or reject 
           as an output. 
           <br><br>
           For example, if input string is \(1101101\), this automaton processes the string as follows: 
           <br><br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Start reading
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 1, move from \(q_1\) to \(q_2\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 1, stay \(q_2\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 0, move \(q_3\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 1, move  \(q_2\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 1, stay \(q_2\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 0, move \(q_3\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 1, move \(q_2\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;End reading Return "accept." 
           <br><br>
            This automaton recognizes any string contains at least one 1 and an even number of 0s follow the last 1. 
        </blockquote>

        <h1>Regular Operations</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Let \(A\) and \(B\) be languages. The regular operations ared defined as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Union</strong>:</li>
                \(A \cup B = \{x | x \in A \text{or } x \in B\}\)
                <li><strong>Concatenation</strong>:</li>
                \(A \circ B = \{xy | x \in A \text{and } y \in B\}\)
                <li><strong>Star</strong>:</li>
                \(A^* = \{x_1x_2 \cdots x_k | k \geq 0 \text{and each } x_i \in A\}\)
            </ul>
