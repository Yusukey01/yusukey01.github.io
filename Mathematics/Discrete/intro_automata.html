        <blockquote>
            <strong>Automata theory</strong> is a foundational area of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics that studies abstract 
            machines and computational problems. It provides a rigorous framework for understanding <strong>formal languages</strong>, state-based 
            computation, and algorithmic processes. For instance, automata theory is essential in compiler design, natural language processing, 
            software verification, and the study of complexity classes in the <strong>theory of computation</strong>. By exploring automata theory, we 
            will develop a deeper understanding of computation, logic, and the mathematical principles governing algorithmic processes.

        <blockquote>
            Since real computers are too complicated, depending on the features we want to focus on, we introduce different <strong>computational models</strong>. 
            The simplest computational model can be the <strong>finite automaton (finite state machine)</strong>.
            <br><br>
            A <strong>finite automaton</strong> is a 5-tuple \((Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\) where 
            <ul>
                <li>\(Q\) is a finite set called the <strong>states</strong></li>
                <li>\(\Sigma\) is a finite set called the <strong>alphabet</strong></li>
                <li>\(\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q\) is the <strong>transition function</strong></li>
                <li>\(q_0 \in Q\) is the <strong>start state</strong></li>
                <li>\(F \subseteq Q\) is the set of <strong>accept states</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Let \(A\) be the set of all strings that machine \(M\) accepts. We say that \(A\) is the <strong>language</strong> of 
            machine \(M\) and write:
            \[
            L(M) = A 
            \]
            We also say that \(M\) <strong>recognizes</strong> \(A\). Moreover, a language is called a <strong>regular language</strong> if 
            some finite automaton recognizes it.
            <br><br>
            Consider the following finite automaton. 
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="DFA_example1.jpg" alt="Finite automata" style="width:600px;">
            </div> 
           First, this directed multigraph is called the <strong>state diagram</strong> of the finite automaton.
           It has three states, \(Q = \{q_0, q_1, q_2\}\), where \(q_0\) is the start state, and \(F = \{q_1\}\) is the 
           accept state which is denoted by a double circle. The arrows are transitions \(\delta\) from one state to another state.
           This automaton processes some string(in this case, \(\Sigma =\{0, 1\}\)) as an input and returns either accept or reject 
           as an output. 
           <br><br>
           For example, if input string is \(1101101\), this automaton processes the string as follows: 
           <br><br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Start reading
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 1, move from \(q_0\) to \(q_1\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 1, stay in \(q_1\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 0, move to \(q_2\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 1, move to \(q_1\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 1, stay in \(q_1\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 0, move to \(q_2\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Read 1, move to \(q_1\)
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;End reading 
           <br>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Return "accept." 
           <br><br>
           This automaton recognizes strings that end 1 with an even number of 0s. For example, "10100" is recognized because 
           it ends 1 with two 0s, but "1011000" is not because it ends three 0s. Also, a string ends 1 means it ends 1 with zero 0s, 
           and it is recognized since zero is an even number.

        <h1 id="regular_op">Regular Operations</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Let \(A\) and \(B\) be languages. The regular operations are defined as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Union</strong>:</li>
                \(A \cup B = \{x \, | \,x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}\)
                <li><strong>Concatenation</strong>:</li>
                \(A \circ B = \{xy \, |\, x \in A \text{ and } y \in B\}\)
                <br>
                Note: \(\emptyset \circ A = \emptyset\), and \(\{\epsilon\} \circ A = A\).
                <br>
                Note: \(A \circ A = A^2\), and we define \(A^0 = \{\epsilon\}\).
                <li><strong>Star</strong>:</li>
                \(A^* = \{x_1x_2 \cdots x_k \, | \, k \geq 0 \text{ and each } x_i \in A\}\)
                <br>
                In other words, 
                <br>
                \(A^* = A^0 \cup A^1 \cup A^2 \cup \cdots\).
                <br>
                Note: The <strong>empty string</strong> \(\epsilon\) is always an element of \(A^*\) because 
                it includes the case where \(k=0\).
                <br>
                Note:\(\emptyset^* = \{\epsilon\}\) since \(\emptyset^* = \emptyset^0 \cup \emptyset^1 \cup \emptyset^2 \cup \cdots\).
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            For example, Let \(\Sigma = \{a, \, b, \, c, \, \cdots, \, x, \, y, \, z\}\). 
            If \(A = \{black, \, white\}\) and \(B = \{dog,  \, cat\}\), then 
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            &A \cup B = \{black, \, white, \, dog,  \, cat \} \\\\
            &A \circ B  = \{blackdog, \, blackcat, \, whitedog, \, whitecat\} \\\\
            &A^* = \{\epsilon, \, black, \, white, \, balckblack, \, blackwhite, \, whiteblack, \, whitewhite, \, blackblackblack, \, blackblackwhite, \,
            \   \cdots\}
            \end{align*}
            \]

                The class of regular languages is closed under regular operations. 
                <br>
                In other words, if languages \(A\) and \(B\) are regular, then \(A \cup B\), \(A \circ B\), 
                \(A^*\), and \(B^*\) are also regular languages.

                <span class="proof-title">Proof: Closure under union</span> 
                Suppose we have two finite automata
                \[
                M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, {q_0}_1, F_1)
                \]
                and

                M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2, {q_0}_2, F_2).
                \]
                These can recognize regular languages \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) respectively. 
                <br>
                Here, we <strong>construct</strong> \(M_3\) to recognize \(A_1 \cup A_2\) as follows:
                \[
                M_3 = (Q_3, \Sigma, \delta_3, {q_0}_3, F_3)
                \]
                where 
                \[
                Q_3 = Q_1 \times Q_2 = \{(q_1, q_2)\, | \, q_1 \in Q_1 \text{ and } q_2 \in Q_2\}
                \]
                <br>
                \[
                \delta_3((q_1, q_2), a) = (\delta_1(q_1, a), \delta_2(q_2, a)) \quad \forall a \in  \Sigma
                \]
                <br>
                \[
                {q_0}_3 = ({q_0}_1, {q_0}_2)
                \]
                <br>
                \[
                F_3 = \{(q_1, q_2) \,| \, q_1 \in F_1 \text{ or } q_2 \in F_2 \}
                \] 
                which is the same as \((F_1 \times Q_2) \cup (Q_1 \times F_2)\).
                <br>
            </div>
             Note: If we say \(F_3 = F_1 \times F_2\), the resulting language is the <strong>intersection</strong>. Actually, the class of 
            regular languages is closed under intersection too.

        <h1 id="dfa">Deterministic & Nondeterministic Machine</h1>
        <blockquote>
            So far, we consider <strong>deterministic</strong> computations because we always know what the next state will be 
            based on the next input symbol. however, it is natural that a computation have multiple choices for the next state? 
            Such a computation is said to be <strong>nondeterministic</strong>. Technically, every deterministic finite automaton 
            (<strong>DFA</strong>) is a nondeterministic finite automaton (<strong>NFA</strong>) because determinism is just a 
            special case of nondeterminism.
            <br><br>
            A <strong>nondeterministic finite automaton</strong> is a 5-tuple \((Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\) where 
            <ul>
                <li>\(Q\) is a finite set of states</li>
                <li>\(\Sigma\) is a finite alphabet</li>
                <li>\(\delta: Q \times \Sigma_{\epsilon} \to \mathcal{P}(Q)\) is the transition function</li>
                <li>\(q_0 \in Q\) is the start state</li>
                <li>\(F \subseteq Q\) is the set of accept states</li>
            </ul>
            where \(\Sigma_{\epsilon} = \Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\}\) and \(\mathcal{P}(Q)\) is the <strong>power set</strong> of \(Q\).
            <br><br>
            Note: The power set of a set is the set of all possible subsets of that set, including the empty set and the set itself. For example, 
            if \(Q = \{a, b, c\}\), then \(\mathcal{P}(Q) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a, b\}, \{a, c\}, \{b, c\}, \{a, b, c\}\} \). So, if 
            a set has \(n\) elements, its power set has \(2^n\) elements. 
            <br><br>
            At each state, the NFA can split itself into multiple branches and keeps following all the possible branches in parallel. 
            In other words, the NFA can have multiple active states at once, while the DFA always has a single active state. If at least one 
            of branches accepts, then whole computation accepts. 
            <br>
            Note: The NFA sounds like parallel computation, but in "actual" parallel computation, multiple processors or threads execute 
            tasks concurrently, often with considerations for synchronization, communication, and resource sharing. NFAs don't model 
            these practical concerns. 
            <br><br>
            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Theorem 2: </span>
               Every NFA  has an <strong>equivalent</strong> DFA.

               In other words, every NFA can be converted into an equivalent DFA.
            </div>  
            The theorem only says both NFA and DFA can recognize <strong>the same class of languages</strong>.  Normally, the NFA is smaller 
            and easier to understand than its equivalent DFA. So, we cannot treat them equivalently in terms of convenience.
