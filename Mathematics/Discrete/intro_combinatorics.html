        <h1>Combinatorics</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Combinatorics</strong> is a fundamental area of discrete mathematics that focuses on counting, arranging, and analyzing structures. 
            It provides powerful techniques to solve problems related to permutations, combinations, graph enumeration, discrete probability, and more. 
            These combinatorial methods are indispensable in fields such as computer science, cryptography, and optimization. In particular, they play 
            a crucial role in machine learning, where they contribute to algorithms for data analysis, pattern recognition, and optimization problems. 
            Additionally, combinatorics finds practical applications in network design and error-correcting codes. By exploring combinatorics, we will 
            gain profound insights into mathematical structures and their inherent properties,

        <h1>Counting</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Probably, readers are familiar with basic counting methods, but we revisit important ideas as an introduction. 
            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title"> Fundamental Counting Principle</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rule of Sum:</li>
                    If a set can be expressed as the disjoint union of two (or more) subsets, then the number of elements in the set is the sum 
                    of the numbers of elements in the subsets.
                    <li>Rule of Product:</li>
                    Consider a (finite) sequence of decisions. Suppose the number of choices for each individual decision is independent of 
                    decisions made previously in the sequence. Then the number of ways to make the whole sequence of decisions is the product 
                    of these numbers of choices.   
                </ul>
           </div>
           Remember, we have two ways to look at the <strong>combination</strong>
            \[
            {}_n C_r = C(n, r) = \binom{n}{r}.
            \] 
           One is the <strong>combinatorial</strong> definition: "\(n\) choose \(r\)" is the number of ways to choose \(r\) things 
           from a collection of \(n\) things. 
           <br>
           Alternatively, by the <strong>algebraic</strong> definition,
           \[
            C(n, r)= \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.
            \] 
            This is also called a <strong>binomial coefficient</strong> because this is a special case of 
            <strong>multinomial coefficient</strong>:
            \[
            \binom{n}{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_k} = \frac{n!}{r_1! r_2! \cdots r_k!}.
            \]
           Here, if \(r_1 + r_2 + \cdots + r_k = n\), then  
           \[
           \binom{n}{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_k} = \binom{n}{r_1}\binom{n-r_1}{r_2}\binom{n-r_1-r_2}{r_3} \cdots \binom{n-r_1-r_2 - \cdots - r_{k-1}}{r_k}.
           \]
           <br>
           Let's observe a couple of combination-related theorems:
           <div class="theorem">
            <span class="theorem-title"> Pascal's Relation</span>
            If \(1 \geq r \geq n\), then 
            \[
            C(n+1, r)=  C(n, r-1) + C(n, r).
            \]
           </div>
           <div class="proof">
            <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
            Suppose we have a \(n+1\)-elements set \(\{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n, y\}\) and its \(r\)-element subsets 
            can be partitioned into two families, those that contain \(y\) and those that do not. the \(r\)-element 
            subsets that do not contain \(y\) are exactly the \(r\)-element subsets of \(\{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n\}\) of which 
            there are \(\binom{n}{r}\) ways. On the other hand, to count the subsets contain \(y\), \(r-1\) elements can be chosen 
            from \(\{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n\}\), which are \(\binom{n}{r-1}\) ways.
           </div>
           <div class="theorem">
            <span class="theorem-title"> Chu's Theorem</span>
            If \(n \geq r\), then
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            \sum_{k=0}^n C(k,r) &= C(r, r) + C(r+1, r) + C(r+2, r) + \cdots + C(n, r) \\\\
                                &= C(n+1, r+1).
            \end{align*}
            \]
           </div>
           <div class="proof">
            <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
            If we replace \(C(r,r)\) with \(C(r+1, r+1)\), then by Pascal's relation,
            \[
            C(r+1, r+1) + C(r+1, r) = C(r+2, r+1)
            \]
            and again by Pascal's relation, we have 
            \[
            C(r+2, r+1) + C(r+2, r) = C(r+3, r+1).
            \]
            If we repeate this process, we obtain
            \[
            C(n, r+1) C(n, r) = C(n+1, r+1).
            \]
           </div>
           We know the sum of first \(n\) positive integers is obtained by 
           \[
           1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
           \]
           Equivalently, we can consider this equation as the Chu's Theorem with \(r =1\):
           \[
           C(1, 1) + C(2,1) + \cdots + C(n, 1) = C(n+1, 2).
           \]
           This perspective is indeed, very useful. Consider the sum of the squares of first \(n\) positive integers:
           \[
           1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.
           \]
           We can prove it by induction, but in the first place, how can we get the formula? Yes, we can use Chu's Theorem again.
           \[
           k^2 = k + k(k-1) = C(k, 1) + 2C(k, 2)
           \]
           and summing both sides, we get 
           \[
           \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \sum_{k=1}^n C(k, 1)  + 2\sum_{k=1}^n C(k,2).
           \]
           Thus, 
           \[
           \begin{align*}
           1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 &= C(n+1, 2)  + 2C(n+1, 3) \\\\
                                    &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 2 \frac{(n+1)n(n-1)}{6}\\\\
                                    &= n(n+1)\left[\frac{3+ 2(n-1)}{6}\right] \\\\
                                    &= \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.
           \end{align*}
           \]
           In general, 
           <div class="theorem">
            <span class="theorem-title"> Sum of \(m\)'th power of positive integers</span>
            \[
            k^m = \sum_{r=1}^m a_{r, m} C(k, r)
            \]
            where \(a_{r, m} is independent of \(k\), and 1 \geq r \geq m\).
            Summing both sides and using Chu's Theorem, 
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            \sum_{k=1}^n k^m &= \sum_{k=1}^m \sum_{r=1}^m a_{r, m} C(k, r)  \\\\
                            &= \sum_{r=1}^m a_{r, m} \sum_{k=1}^m C(k, r) \\\\
                            & = \sum_{r=1}^m a_{r, m} C(n+1, r+1).
            \end{align*}
            \]
           </div>
           For example, if \(m =3\),
           \[
           \begin{align*}
           k^3 &= x_1 C(k, 1) + x_2C(k,2) +x_3C(k,3) \\\\
               &= x_1k + \frac{x_2 k(k-1)}{2}+ \frac{x_3k(k-1)(k-2)}{6} \\\\
           \end{align*}
           \]
           and we have
           \[
           6k^3 = (6x_1 -3x_2 + 2x_3)k + (3x_2 -3x_3)k^2 + x_3k^3.
           \]
           Solve this equation, we obtain \(x_1 = a_{1,3} = 1, \, x_2 = a_{2,3} = 6, \, x_3 = a_{3,3} = 6\). 
           Hence, 
           \[
           k^3 = C(k,1) + 6C(k,2) + 6C(k,3)
           \]
           and  
           \[
           1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3 = C(n+1, 2) + 6C(n+1, 3) + 6C(n+1, 4) = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}.
           \]
           Instead of solving the system of equations, we can use linear algebra: 
           <br>
           For \(m =4\), 
            \[
            C_4 = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 3 & 3  & 1 & 0 \\ 4 & 6 & 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            and 
            \[
            C_4^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 3 & -3 & 1 & 0 \\ -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
            \]
           (You can see the portion of Pascal's triangle.)
           Now, we compute 
           \[
           \begin{align*}
           &\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 3 & -3 & 1 & 0 \\ -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
           \begin{bmatrix}1^1 & 1^2 & 1^3 & 1^4 \\ 2^1 & 2^2 & 2^3 & 2^4 \\ 3^1 & 3^2 & 3^3 & 3^4 \\ 4^1 & 4^2 & 4^3 & 4^4 \end{bmatrix} \\\\
           &= \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 & 6 & 14 \\ 0 & 0 & 6 & 36 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 24 \end{bmatrix}
           \end{align*}
           \]
           Thus, 
           \[
           k^4 = C(k,1) + 14C(k,2) + 36C(k,3) + 24C(k,4).
           \]
