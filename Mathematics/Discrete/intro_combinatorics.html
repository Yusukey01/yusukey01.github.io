        <h1>Combinatorics</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Combinatorics</strong> is a fundamental area of discrete mathematics that focuses on counting, arranging, and analyzing structures. 
            It provides powerful techniques to solve problems related to permutations, combinations, graph enumeration, discrete probability, and more. 
            These combinatorial methods are indispensable in fields such as computer science, cryptography, and optimization. In particular, they play 
            a crucial role in machine learning, where they contribute to algorithms for data analysis, pattern recognition, and optimization problems. 
            Additionally, combinatorics finds practical applications in network design and error-correcting codes. By exploring combinatorics, we will 
            gain profound insights into mathematical structures and their inherent properties,

        <h1>Counting</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Probably, readers are familiar with basic counting methods, but we revisit important ideas as introduction.

                <ul>
                    <li>Rule of Sum:</li>
                    If a set can be expressed as the disjoint union of two (or more) subsets, then the number of elements in the set is the sum 
                    of the numbers of elements in the subsets.
                    <li>Rule of Product:</li>
                    Consider a (finite) sequence of decisions. Suppose the number of choices for each individual decision is independent of 
                    decisions made previously in the sequence. Then the number of ways to make the whole sequence of decisions is the product 
                    of these numbers of choices.   
                </ul>
           </div>
           we know that the <strong>combination</strong> is the same as <strong>multinomial coefficient</strong>: 
           \[
            {}_n C_r = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} = \frac{ {}_n P_r }{r!}
            \] 
            This is a reason why the combination is commonly called a <strong>binomial coefficient</strong>.
