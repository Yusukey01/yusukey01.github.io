            <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Yusuke Yokota</strong>.</p>
            <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Math-CS Compass</strong>, where <strong>pure & applied mathematics</strong> meet <strong>computer science</strong>. 
            I created this site after noticing that while many computer science people rely heavily on mathematical concepts, they often lack a clear overview 
            of these ideas, especially in today's AI-driven era. On the other hand, those deeply involved in pure mathematics sometimes overlook the practical 
            applications of their work. While pure mathematicians often prefer formal, rigorous explanations, and computer scientists tend to focus more on experimental 
            results, I believe that understanding how mathematics translates into real-world applications can enrich both theoretical work for mathematicians and innovation 
            for computer scientists.
            </p>
            <p>
            This platform is designed to bridge that gap: it offers an accessible look at the math world, highlighting connections that are especially relevant in 
            the current landscape of AI and technology. It's not purely theoretical math, nor is it overly casual—it's a resource intended to inspire both math 
            enthusiasts and computer scientists alike.
            </p>

            I would also like to express my deep appreciation to the <strong>Western Washington University</strong> Mathematics and Computer Science Departments' students and 
            faculty members. Their passion and inspiration have been a tremendous source of motivation in creating this platform after I graduated.
