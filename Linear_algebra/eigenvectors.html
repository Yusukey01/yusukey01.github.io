        <h1>Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues</h1>
        <blockquote>
            An <strong>eigenvector</strong> of an \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\) is a "nonzero" vector \(x\) such that
            \[Ax = \lambda x \tag{1}\]
            for some scalar \(\lambda\), which is called an <strong>eigenvalue</strong> of \(A\) if there is a
            nontrivial solution \(x\) to equation (1). Such an \(x\) is referred to as an eigenvector corresponding to \(\lambda\).
            Equation (1) can be written as: \[(A - \lambda I)x = 0 \tag{2}\] 
            The scalar \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\) iff (2) has a nontrivial solution. The set of all solutions
            of (2) is the null space \(Nul(A - \lambda I) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) and is called the <strong>eigenspace</strong> of \(A\)
            corresponding to the eigenvalue \(\lambda\).

                The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are its main diagonal entries.

                Suppose \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3} \) is a lower triangular matix, and \(\lambda\) is an
                eigenvalue of \(A\). Then, 
                \[A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 
                    a_{11} - \lambda & 0 & 0 \\ 
                    a_{21} & a_{22} - \lambda & 0 \\
                    a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} - \lambda \\
                    \end{bmatrix}.
                \]
                Since \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\), \((A-\lambda I)x =0\) has a nontrivial solution. 
                In other words, the equation has a free variable. 
                This occurs if and only if at least one of the main diagonal entries is zero 
                so that \(\lambda\) is equal to one of the main diagonal entries of \(A\). 
                The same reasoning applies to upper triangular matrices and higher-dimensional cases.
            </div>

            For example, 
            \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 8 \\  0 & 2 & 7 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \\ \end{bmatrix}\]
            has eigenvalues; \(0, 2, \text{and } 3\). Since \(A\) has a zero eigenvalue, equation (1) becomes
            the homogeneous equation \(Ax =0\), which must have a nontrivil solution. This happens iff 
            <strong>\(A\) is a singular matrix(NOT invertible).</strong> 
            We can verify this by computing:
            \(det A = 0(6-0)-(0-0)+8(0-0)=0\). Since \(detA=0\), \(A\) is indeed not invertible.

                If \(v_1, \cdots, v_n\) are eigenvectors corresponding to "distinct" eigenvalues \(\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n\)
                of a square matrix \(A\), then the set \(\{v_1, \cdots, v_n\}\) is linearly independent.

                <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                Assume the set of eigenvectors \(\{v_1, \cdots, v_n\}\) is linearly "dependent." 
                By definition, each eigenvector \(v_i\) is nonzero. If the set is dependent, at least 
                one eigenvector \(v_{i+1}\) can be written as a linear combination of the preceding 
                eigenvectors. Let \(i\) be the least index so that \(v_{i+1}\) is a linear combination 
                of the preceding eigenvectors. Then there exist scalars \(c_1, \cdots, c_i\) such that
                \[
                v_{i+1} = c_1v_1 + \cdots + c_iv_i, \quad c_1, \cdots, c_i \in \mathbb{R}. \tag{3}
                \]
                Multiplying both sides of (3) by a square \(A\), we get: 
                \[
                c_1Av_1 + \cdots + c_iAv_i = Av_{i+1}
                \]
                By definition of eigenvalues & eigenvectors, (3) becomes
                \[
                c_1 \lambda_1 v_1 + \cdots + c_i \lambda_i v_i = \lambda_{i+1} v_{i+1}. \tag{4}
                \]
                Subtracting \(\lambda_{i+1}\) times (3) from (4), we get: 
                \[
                c_1(\lambda_1 - \lambda_{i+1}) v_1 + \cdots + c_i(\lambda_i - \lambda_{i+1} )v_i = 0. \tag{5}
                \]
                All coefficients in (5) must be zero since \(\{ v_1, \cdots, v_i\}\) is linerarly independent.
                However, \((\lambda_1 - \lambda_{i+1}), \cdots, (\lambda_i - \lambda_{i+1} )\) are nonzero because 
                the eigenvalues are distinct. Hence, \(c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_i = 0\). This is contradicting equation (3)
                Therefore, the set \(\{v_1, \cdots, v_n\}\) must be linearly independent set.

        <h1>Characteristic equations</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A scalar \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue of an \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\) iff \(\lambda\) satisfies
            the <strong>characteristic equation</strong> 
            \[det (A - \lambda I) = 0.\]
            For example, consider the matrix 
            \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 & 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\]
            Then, 
            \[det(A- \lambda I) = (1-\lambda)(-\lambda^2 -\lambda -24) -0 +5(5 +3\lambda) = 0 \]
            Expanding this, we obtain the <strong>characteristic polynomial</strong>:
            \[-\lambda^3 +2\lambda^2 + 38\lambda +1 = 0\]
            Solving this equation for \(\lambda\), we get eigenvalues for \(A\): \(\lambda \approx -5.230, -0.026, 7.256\).
            Like this example, in practice, we typically approximate eigenvalues using numerical methods.
            <br><br>
            The <strong>algebraic multiplicity</strong> of an eigenvalue is its multiplicity as a root of the 
            characteristic equation.
            <br><br>
            For example, if the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is \((\lambda -1)^2 (\lambda -2) = 0\), then 
            the eigenvalue 1 has multiplicity 2. 
            <br><br>
            Next, we introduce the concept of <strong>similarity</strong> of matrices. Suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are 
            \(n \times n\) matrices. Then, \(A\) is said to be similar to \(B\) if there exists an invertible matrix \(P\) such that 
            \[
            P^{-1}AP =B \quad \text{, or equivalently, } A=PBP^{-1}.
            \]
            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Theorem 3:</span>  
                "If" \(n \times n\) matrices \(A\) and \(B\) are similar, "then" they have the same characteristic
                polynomial and thus the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicities.
                <br>
                Note: the converse of this theorem is not true. Having the same eigenvalues does not imply 
                the matrices are similar.
            </div>
            <div class="proof">
                <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                If \(B = P^{-1}AP\), then 
                \[
                B - \lambda I = P^{-1}AP - \lambda P^{-1}P = P^{-1}(A - \lambda I)P
                \]
                By the multiplicative property of determinants, we have
                \[
                \det (B-\lambda I) = \det (P^{-1}) \det (A-\lambda I) \det (P) = \det (A-\lambda I).
                \]
                Note: \(\det (P^{-1}P) = \det (I) = 1\).

        <h1>Diagonalization</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A square matrix \(A\) is said to be <strong>diagonalizable</strong> if for some invertible matrix \(P\),
            \(A\) is similar to a diagonal matrix \(D\). \[A = PDP^{-1}\]
            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Theorem 4: Diagonalization</span>  
                An \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\) is diagonalizable iff \(A\) has \(n\) linearly independent eigenvectors.
                Thus, the columns of \(P\) are linearly independent eigenvectors of \(A\) and the diagonal entries of \(D\)
                are eigenvalues of \(A\) corresponding to the eigenvectors in \(P\). 
                Note: \(P\) and \(D\) are not unique because the order of the diagonal entries in \(D\) can be changed.
            </div>
            <div class="proof">
                <span class="proof-title">Proof:</span>
                Let \(P\) be a square matrix with columns \(v_1, \cdots, v_n\) and \(D\) be a diagonal matrix with
                diagonal entries \(\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n \). Then, 
                \[AP = \begin{bmatrix}Av_1 & \cdots & Av_n \\\end{bmatrix}\]
                \[PD = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1 v_1 & \cdots & \lambda_n v_n \\\end{bmatrix}\]
                Assume \(A\) is diagonalizable, so \(A = PDP^{-1}\). 
                By multiplying both sides of this equation on the right by \(P\), we get:
                \[AP = AD\].
                Thus, for each columns of \(AP\), we have
                \[
                Av_1 = \lambda_1 v_1, \cdots, Av_n = \lambda_n v_n. \tag{1}
                \]
                Since \(P\) is invertible, its colums are linearly independent and must be nonzero.
                From equation (1), \(\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n \) are eigenvalues, and \(v_1, \cdots, v_n\) are 
                corresponding eigenvectors.
                <br><br>
                Finally, consider any \(n\) eigenvectors \(v_1, \cdots, v_n\). We can construct \(P\) and \(D\) from 
                from these eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues \(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n\).
                If the eigenvectors are linearly independent, then \(P\) is invertible, and we obtain \(A = P D P^{-1}\).
            </div>
            For example, given
            \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 & 1\\ 1 & 4 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 4 \\ \end{bmatrix},\] 
            computing the characteristic equation:
            \[det(A- \lambda I) = (4-\lambda)((4-\lambda)^2 - 1) -((4-\lambda )-1)+(1-(4 -\lambda)) = 0 \]
            Simplifying this, we get:
            \[-\lambda^3 +12\lambda^2 -45\lambda -54 = 0,\]
            which factors as
            \[(\lambda - 3)^2(\lambda -6) = 0\]
            Thus, eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 3\), \(\lambda_2 = 3\), and \(\lambda_3 = 6\). Next, we need to find three linearly
            independent eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. 
            <br>For \(\lambda_1 = 3\) and \(\lambda_2 = 3\):
            \[A-3I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} 
            \xrightarrow{\text{rref}}
            \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\end{bmatrix}
            \]
            We choose the eigenvectors \(v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}\) \(\lambda_1 = 3\) 
            \(v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\)  
            <br>For \(\lambda_3 = 6\):
            \[A-6I = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & 1 & 1\\ 1 & -2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & -2 \\ \end{bmatrix}
            \xrightarrow{\text{rref}}
            \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\end{bmatrix}
            \]
            We choose the eigenvector \(v_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}\).
            <br>Therefore, \(D = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 6 \\\end{bmatrix} \quad\), 
            \(P= \begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\end{bmatrix} \quad\), and finally
            \(P^{-1}= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{-1}{3} & \frac{-1}{3} & \frac{2}{3} \\
            \frac{-1}{3} & \frac{2}{3} & \frac{-1}{3}\\
            \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \\\end{bmatrix}\).
            <br><br>
            As you can see, It is <strong>"not necessary"</strong> that an \(n \times n\) matrix has \(n\) "distinct" eigenvalues 
            in order to be diagonalizable (Note: if the matrix has \(n\) distinct eigenvalues, the matrix must be diagonalizable.)

        <h1>Complex Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</h1>
        <blockquote>
            It is possible for the characteristic equation to have complex roots. A complex scalar
            \(\lambda\) satisifes the characteristic equation \(det(A -\lambda I) = 0\) iff there is a nonzero vector
            \(x \in \mathbb{C}^n\) such that \(Ax = \lambda x\). In this case, \(\lambda\) is called a <strong>complex eigenvalue</strong>
            and \(x\) is its corresponding <strong>complex eigenvector</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Now  let's examine the details of the rotation matrix. In general, rotation matrices are not always diagonalizable in
            \(\mathbb{R}^n\) but in \(\mathbb{C}^n\), real rotation matrices are always diagonalizable.
            (Think about the reasoning after you learned  <a href="orthogonality.html"><strong>Part 7: Orthogonality </strong></a> 
            and <a href="symmetry.html"><strong>Part 9: Symmetry</strong></a> .)
            <br><br>
            Consider the matrix \(R = \begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \end{bmatrix}\), 
            where \(a\) and \(b\) are real and not both nonzero. Then the "complex" eigenvalues of \(R\) can be found by 
            solving the characteristic equation:
             \[
             \det (R - \lambda I)=0 
             \Longrightarrow
             \lambda^2 -2a\lambda +(a^2 + b^2) = 0 
             \Longrightarrow
             (\lambda -(a+bi))(\lambda -(a-bi)) = 0
             \]
            Thus, we get complex eigenvalues \(\lambda = a \pm bi\), and we can find comlex eigenvectors: 
            \[
            Rv_1 = \begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i \\ \end{bmatrix}
               = \begin{bmatrix} a + bi \\ b - ai\\ \end{bmatrix} 
               = (a+bi)\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i \\ \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            Hence, \(v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i \\ \end{bmatrix}\) is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(\lambda = a + bi\). 
            Moreover, the complex conjugate of \(\lambda\), denoted \(\bar{\lambda} = a - bi\), is an eigenvalue with 
            its corresponding eigenvector \(v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ i \\ \end{bmatrix}\).
            Therefore, we can diagonalize \(R\): 
            \[
            R = PDP^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ -i & i\end{bmatrix}
                           \begin{bmatrix} a+bi & 0 \\ 0 & a-bi \end{bmatrix}
                           \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} 1  & i \\ 1 & -i\end{bmatrix}
                        = \begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            <br>
            Mapped back to \(\mathbb{R}^2\), this diagonalization reflects the polar decomposition of \(R\) into  
            a rotation angle \(\varphi\) and scaling magnitude \(r\).
            Let \(r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) be the magnitude of \(\lambda\), so  \(|\lambda | = r \).
            Now, we can express the matrix \(R\) in polar form. Let \(\varphi\) be the angle(<strong>argument</strong> of \(\|\lambda \| = r\)) such that 
            \(\cos \varphi = \frac{a}{r}\) and \(\sin \varphi = \frac{b}{r}\). Then \(R\) can be written as:
            \[
            R = r \begin{bmatrix} \frac{a}{r} & \frac{-b}{r} \\ \frac{b}{r} & \frac{a}{r} \\ \end{bmatrix}
              = \begin{bmatrix} r & 0 \\ 0 & r \\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \cos \varphi & -\sin \varphi \\ \sin \varphi & \cos \varphi \\ \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            This is the standard form of a rotation matrix in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). 
            <br><br>
            Note: In general, given a nonzero complex number \(z\), \( \, a = |z| \cos \varphi , \quad b =  |z| \sin \varphi \, \) and so
            \[z = a + bi = |z| (\cos \varphi\ + i\sin \varphi ) \]
            whhere \(\varphi = \arg z\).
